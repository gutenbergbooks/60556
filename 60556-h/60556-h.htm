VALE-MOUTH.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Is situate in the hundred of Kerryer, and hath upon the
north Budock; east, the haven or harbour of Falmouth;
south, the Black Rock and Pendennis Castle; west, Budock,
and the British Channel. For the name, it is taken
from the Vale river’s mouth, which here empties itself into
the British Ocean. And the river itself takes its name
from its original fountain in Roach, under Haynes-burrow,
called Pen-ta-Vale, Fenton, or Venton; that is to say, the
head or chief, good or consecrated, spring or well of water,
or river Valley, from thence called the Vale river. This place,
in Cornish, is called Val-genow, or Fal-genne; in Saxon,
Val-mune; in English, Vale-mouth, synonymous therewith.</p>

<p>This harbour of Falmouth, as mariners tell us, is in all
respects the largest and safest haven for ships that this
Island of Britain affordeth. Its mouth or entrance from
the British Ocean, between the Castles of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes and
Pendennis, situate in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony and Falmouth parishes,
is about a mile and a half distant, the centre or middle
thereof above a league, from the said mouth or entrance
up the Vale river, by the Rock Island aforesaid, to Carike
Road, King’s Road, and Turner’s Wear, south-east
about two leagues from thence, still on the Vale river, a
<!--006.png--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
navigable arm or channel of the said harbour, extendeth
itself up the country, by Trejago Creek and Castle, towards
the incorporate town of Tregony, to the Bridge Place of
which it formerly was navigable. [See <span class="sc">Cuby</span>.] And it
is overlooked on the south-east side, by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, Philley, Ruan Langhorne, and Cuby parishes.
Within the said parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony are
also two navigable creeks or channels. Near the castle
and incorporate town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes, (where formerly stood
a monastery of Black Canons Augustine, dedicated to the
Virgin Mary, called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Vale, for that it was situated
on the Vale harbour or river, as its superior monastery
is from the Plym river, in Devon, called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de
Plym, whereon it is situate,) from the north-west part of
this harbour of Falmouth, between the parishes of Budock,
Gluvias, and Milor, another navigable channel extendeth
itself up the country to the incorporate town of Penryn.
And towards the north another channel or arm thereof,
higher up, extendeth itself through the country from the
centre about a league, and is navigable to Peran Well and
Carnan Bridge. Further up, north-east, another arm or
channel of Falmouth Harbour extends itself to the incorporate
and coinage town of Truro, and the manor of
Moris, and is navigable there about nine miles distance
from the Black Rock, or island aforesaid. Lastly,
another branch of this harbour extendeth itself to Tresilian
Bridge, where it is navigable between the parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Erme, Probus, and Merther, about ten miles from the
mouth of the haven, all which members or branches of the
harbour of Falmouth are overlooked with lofty and pleasant
hills and vales of land, and within the memory of man
abounding with flourishing woods and groves of timber;
and before that time Leland the antiquary, in his Itinerary,
tells us that this river Vale in his days was encompassed
about with the loftiest woods, oaks, and timber-trees that
this kingdom afforded <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> and therefore was
by the Britons called Cassi-ter, or Casse-ter, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> wood land,
<!--007.png--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
from which place and haven the Greeks fetching tin, called
it in their language κασσιτερος, <dfn>cassiteros</dfn>, stanum, and the
island aforesaid the Cassiteridan Island. But, alas! now
this commodity tin hath made such havock of woods and
timber-trees, in searching for and melting the same, that
scarcely any of them are to be seen in those places; for, the
woods and trees being eradicated, the hills and vales aforesaid
have submitted to agriculture, and are made arable
lands, which abound with cattle, sheep, corn, and pastures.</p>

<p>From the premises I suppose it is evident what Mr.
Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, saith of this harbour of
Falmouth, that 100 sail of ships may lie at anchor within
the same, and none of them see the others main tops, by
reason of the steep hills and long windings of the several
channels thereof. In further praise whereof take these
rhymes:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">In the calme south Valubia Harbour stands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where Vale with Sea doth joyne its pure hands,</div>
  <div class="i0a">’Twixt whome to shipps commodious port is shewne,</div>
  <div class="i0">That makes the riches of the world its owne;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ike-ta and Vale, the Britons’ chiefest pride,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glory of them, and all the world beside,</div>

  <div class="i0">Fetchinge from thence furs, hides, pure corne, and tynn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Before greate Cæsar fought Cassibelynn.</div>
</div>

<p>The parish of Falmouth is a dismembered part of the
old parish of Budock, taxed in the Domesday Roll 1087,
and separated from it by virtue of an Act of Parliament
made 15th Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> whereby that church is deprived of
its rectory, the great and small tithes, as far as the boundaries
of this new parish extends, on the humble petition
of Sir Peter Killigrew, of Arwinike, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> who by his own
bounty, and the charitable benevolence he had begged of
others (by leave of the King and Bishop of Exeter), had
built on his own land a church and cemetery, at the south
end of Falmouth town, whereof he was lord and high lord,
for convenience of himself, his servants, and tenants, that
were far off from Budock church. This church, so built,
<!--008.png--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
he endowed with the tithes aforesaid, as a rectory,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> and so
became patron thereof, or had <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus patronatus</i>; reserving to
himself and his heirs the right of presenting to the Ordinary
a Clerk to be Rector thereof when the same should
become void; and the first Rector, as I take it, that he
presented to this church was Mr. John Bedford. Thus, it
is evident by what ways and means men became patrons of
churches, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> patronum faciunt dos, ædificatio, fundus;
the patrons of churches were either founders, builders, or
benefactors thereof. Jus patronatus est potestas præsentandi
aliquem instituendum ad beneficium ecclesiæ simplex
et vacans. (Statute of Westminster, 13th Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>)
This patronage or advowson Sir Peter Killigrew annexed
to his manor and barton of Arwinick.</p>

<p>This church of Falmouth being thus built and endowed,
it was consecrated according to the rights and ceremonies
for consecration of a church in England by Dr. Seth
Ward, Lord Bishop of Exeter, 1664. Within the chancel
of which church afterwards was laid, in a vaulted grave,
the dead body of its patron and founder, Sir Peter Killigrew,
<abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> The present incumbent Quarm. Sir Peter
Killigrew also gave the first Rector thereof, and his successors
for ever, a house and garden to dwell in, for profit
and pleasure; as also a very rich pulpit-cloth, with gold
fringes, whereon in needlework of gold was placed the letters
I. H. S. Whether it be a contraction of ΙΗΣΟΥΣ Jesus,
or to be construed as being the initial letters of Jesus
Hominum Salvator, or Servator, let others resolve.</p>

<p>Ar-win-ike [I above said is] in this parish, [and signifies]
the beloved still lake, creek, cove, or bosom of waters,
according to the circumstances of the place; on part of
which manor formerly stood the insular island Iktam, or
Ictam, of Diodorus Siculus, before mentioned. Otherwise,
if the name of this place be Ar-wynn-ike, it signifies the
victorious or conquering still lake, cove, or busom of waters;
<!--009.png--><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
perhaps to be so construed with reference to Pendennis
Castle, contiguous with, and built upon Arwinick lands.</p>

<p>This place is the chief mansion of that ancient and famous
family surnamed de Killy-grewe, Killygreu, or Killy-greue,
from a local place in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Herme, called Killygrew
barton, downs, and hill, now in possession of Jago in fee,
where Henry, the son of Maugan de Killygrew, held three
parts of a knight’s fee of lands, and at Trewince in Gerance,
<abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> [according to] Carew’s Survey of
Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 44. Of this family further speaks Mr. Carew,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 150. The stock is ancient, and divers of the branches
have grown to great advancement in calling and livelihood
by their greater deserts.</p>

<p>Sir John Killigrew, knight, 1571, built the greatest part
of the old house now standing here. He married Wolverston
of Wolverston, and had by her issue John Killigrew,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; that married Monk, who had issue by her William
Killigrew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> created the 585th Baronet of England,
patent <abbr title="twenty second">22d</abbr> December, 12th Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 1660, with limitation
to Peter Killigrew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> son of Sir Peter Killigrew
aforesaid, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> This Sir William Killigrew, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> by
ill conduct wasted his whole paternal estate, which was
valued at about 3,000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum; and lastly, sold this
manor and barton of Arwinick to his younger brother, Sir
Peter Killigrew, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> aforesaid, who had issue Sir Peter
Killigrew, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> aforesaid, who married one of the coheirs
of Judge Twysden, and had issue by her George Killigrew,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married Ann, daughter of Sir John Seyntaubyn,
<abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> and had issue by her one daughter.</p>

<p>This Mr. George Killigrew was afterwards, in a drunken
humour, at a tavern in Penryn, slain in the chamber, in a
duel, by Walter Vincent, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> barrister-at-law, who was
tried for his life at Launceston for the fact, and acquitted
by the petty jury, <em>through bribery and indirect
acts and practices, as was generally said</em>; yet this Mr. Vincent,
through anguish and horror at this accident, (as it
was said,) within two years after wasted of an extreme
atrophy of his flesh and spirits, that at length at the table
<!--010.png--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
whereby he was sitting, in the Bishop of Exeter’s palace, in
presence of divers gentlemen, he instantly fell back against
the wall and died.</p>

<p>Sir Peter Killigrew had issue also two daughters, the
one married to Richard Erisey, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and another married
to Martin Lister, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Liston, in Staffordshire, a captain
or lieutenant in Pendenis Castle, under John Earl of
Bath; upon whose issue by her Sir Peter settled much of
his lands, on condition he should assume the name of Killigrew,
and is now in possession of this lordship.</p>

<p>The country people here about will tell you, (as such are
superstitious enough to do,) that this murder or manslaughter
of Mr. Killigrew by Mr. Vincent, whereby the male
line of that family is extinct, was a just judgment of God;
for that Jane Killigrew, widow of Sir John Killigrew, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr>
aforesaid, his great-grandmother, in the Spanish wars in
the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, went on
board two Dutch ships of the Hans Towns, (always
free traders in times of war,) driven into Falmouth Harbour
by cross winds, laden with merchandize, on account
(as was said) of Spaniards, and with a numerous party of
ruffians, murdered the two Spanish merchants or factors
on board those ships, and took from them two barrels or
hogsheads of Spanish pieces of eight, and converted them
to her own use.</p>

<p>Now, though Fleta, Liber 1. <abbr title="chapter three">chap. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
tells us that it is no murder except it be proved that the
party slain was English, and no stranger, yet afterwards, by
the Statute 4 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> his son, <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> 4, the killing any
<em>foreigner under the King’s protection</em>, out of evil design or
malice, is made murder, upon which Statute those offenders
were tried and found guilty at Launceston of wilful
murder, both by the grand and petty juries, and had sentence
of death passed accordingly upon them, and were all
executed, except the said Lady Killigrew, the principal
agent and contriver of the barbarous fact, who, by the interest
and favour of Sir John Arundell, of Tolverne, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr>
and his son-in-law, Sir Nicholas Hals, of Pengersick, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr>
<!--011.png--><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
obtained of Queen Elizabeth a pardon or reprieve for the
said lady, which was seasonably put into the Sheriff of
Cornwall’s hands.</p>

<p>This Lady Jane Killigrew afterwards gave a silver cup
to the Mayors of Penryn for ever, in memory of some kindness
in her troubles received in that Corporation, 1612.
Sir Henry Killigrew, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Elizabeth, was a younger
brother to Sir John Killigrew aforesaid, and followed the
Court for advantage, and to raise his fortunes (according
to the constant genius of his family). He, as Mr. Carew
in his Survey of Cornwall saith, “after embassies and messages,
and many other profitable employments, both of
peace and war, in his prince’s service, to the good of his
country, hath made choice of a retired estate, and was reverently
regarded by all sorts, and places his principal
contentment in himself; which to a life so well acted can
no wise be wanting.” He married Katherine, daughter
of Sir Anthony Cooke, of Giddy Hall, in Essex, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> who
had issue by her a daughter, married to Sir Jonathan Trelawny,
of <a name="err1" id="err1"></a>Poble, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr></p>

<p>This Sir Henry Killigrew, by the favour of Queen Elizabeth,
as a boon procured Gervase Babington, Lord Bishop
of Exeter, 1594, by lease and release, fine and recovery,
to dismember from the church and bishopric of Exeter,
the great manor, barton, and lordship of Kirton, in
Devon, worth 1,000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, rents of assize, which
had been in the possession of the Bishops of Kirton and
Exeter, from the time of Edulphus, the first Bishop thereof,
anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 907, being 687 years to that time; but
long since this manor of land is gone out of the name and
possession of Killigrew. In like manner, about that time
John Coldwell, Lord Bishop of Salisbury, passed the manor
of Sherburne to the Crown, by whom it was given to
Sir Walter Ralegh, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> which is also long since gone out
of his name and family.</p>

<p>The arms of Killigrew are, within a field Argent, an
imperial eagle with two necks, within a bordure Bezanté
<!--012.png--><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
Sable. Which arms and bordure seem to inform us that
this family was indirectly descended from Richard Earl of
Cornwall, King of the Romans, by that concubine Jane de
Valletorta, widow of Sir Alexander Oakeston [see <span class="sc"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen’s by Saltash</span>]. For that, as this bordure
Bezanté Sable was the proper arms of Richard Earl of
Cornwall, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, the imperial eagle was the
cognizance of the said Earl of Cornwall as King of the
Romans.</p>

<p>Within this parish also now stands the borough town of
Falmouth, which compound word is etymologized before.
It was incorporated 14th Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> by the name of the
Mayor and Aldermen and Magistrates of the Borough of
Falmouth, with the jurisdiction of a Court-leet, wherein
plea of debt and damage is tried within its precincts. But,
alas! notwithstanding its present grandeur, neither this
town nor its modern name is of any great antiquity, neither
being extant 500 years past; for long since that time it was
known by no other appellation than that of Smith-ike, that
is, the Smith’s creek, leat, or bosom of waters, from a
smith that lived at the creek, or cove, now in the centre
thereof. And verily, I have been told by some aged persons
lately living, that they remembered not above five
houses standing in this place; though now, I suppose, they
are increased to five or six hundred. And for its name
Falmouth, it was not recorded till, at the request of Sir
Peter Killigrew, it was inserted in its charter of incorporation
as aforesaid. Which thing I do not mention to disparage
this really good name, but to let the inhabitants of
this place, and many other families now flourishing in
Cornwall, know that many of them are mistaken in their
antiquity and former appellations, if truly examined.</p>

<p>Moreover, concerning the first buildings of this town by
John Killigrew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> In 1613, happened a notable controversy
between him and the Corporations of Penryn, Truro,
and Helston, which suggested, by a petition to James the
First, promoted and backed by the interest of the Burgesses
<!--013.png--><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
thereof, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Sir Richard Robartes, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> and John
Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> for Truro; Sir Francis Godolphin, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr>
for Helston; Richard Penwarne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> for Penryn; and
others, “that the erecting of a town at Smith-ike would
tend to the ruin and impoverishing of the ancient coinage-towns
and market-towns aforesaid, not far distant from
thence; and therefore humbly prayed the King’s Majesty
that the buildings and undertakings of Mr. Killigrew
might be inhibited for the future.” Who, upon receipt
and hearing of this petition in Council, ordered the Lords
thereof, Egerton, Buckhurst, Hume, Marre, Sir Robert
Cecil, Principal Secretary of State, and others, to write
to Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongollon, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> then Governor
of Pendennis Castle, to be better informed of the true
merits of this case, and to know his own particular sentiments
about it. Which gentleman, as soon as he received
this letter, made answer, that he well approved of Mr.
Killigrew’s project for building a town and custom-house
at Smith-ike, as being near the mouth of the harbour of
Falmouth; and briefly, amongst many others, for these
reasons especially:</p>

<p>1. For the quick and necessary supply of such ships
whose occasions, or contrary winds, brought them in there,
without being obliged (as then they were) to go up two
miles the river to Penryn, or nine miles to Truro, in order
thereto, or to take in and out their cargoes or lading, and
make entries at the custom-houses at such distance, by reason
of which delays of time they many times lost the opportunity
of a fair wind to prosecute their intended voyages,
longer than was for their advantage.</p>

<p>2. For the speedy supplying or reinforcing the Castle
of Pendennis, contiguous therewith, with men, ammunition,
and provisions, in case of any enemy’s sudden invasion, or
endeavouring to take the same by storm or surprise, before
the country militia could be raised, or recruits brought in
for that purpose.</p>

<p>3. For that other castles for the same reasons were
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
built near towns, or towns erected near them, as Dover,
Portsmouth, Plymouth, Newcastle, Gravesend, and many
more.”</p>

<p>As appears more at large from the letters and reasons of
Sir Nicholas Hals to the Lords of the Council aforesaid,
whereof, by fees to the Clerk of the Council, or Secretary
of State, copies were privately taken forth, at the special
instance and request of the said Richard Penwarne, and
other Members of Parliament then in London, who transmitted
them, by the hands of Mr. Anthony Mundye, to
the Corporation aforesaid, where the writer of these lines
hath had a full view of them, amongst the papers and
records of the borough of Penryn, then lodged in the chest
of its town-hall. Whereupon King James, upon a full
hearing of this controverted matter between the parties
aforesaid, and what could be alleged on either part, gave
his opinion (with which all the Council agreed) that the
erecting a town at Smith-ike by Mr. Killigrew, could in
no sense be prejudicial to the coinage and incorporate
towns aforesaid, they standing at such considerable distances
from it; but especially for that every man might
lawfully do what he would for the utility and advantage of
his own proper goods or lands, without the licence or approbation
even of the King, or any contiguous neighbour,
who had no public or private nuisance thereby done him:
how much more reasonable was it, therefore, when the
owners of such lands converted them to such uses as tended
not only to his own, but the public good and advantage of
the king and country together.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Killigrew proceeded with his intended
buildings, and his tenants, the inhabitants thereof, quickly
grew rich by trade and merchandize both at home and
abroad: so that in about twenty years’ time the town became
notably famous in respect thereof, and is now, for
wealth, trade, and buildings, scarcely inferior to any town
in Cornwall. It is privileged also with a weekly market
on Thursdays, and with fairs upon July 27 and October 30.
<!--015.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
The chief inhabitants of this town are Mr. Russell, Mr.
Tresahar, Mr. Corker, Mr. Hill, Mr. Gwyn.</p>

<p>In this town his Majesty hath his custom-house collector,
comptroller, customer, surveyor, sea and land waiters;
and from this town the packet-boats from the Groyne, Lisbon,
and America, receive their despatches from their
agent, to the great advantage of this place in times of peace
and war: since, as I am informed, removed to Flushing,
in Mylor parish, opposite thereto.</p>

<p>This town also was the honorary title of Charles Lord
Berkeley, Viscount Fitzhardinge, created Lord Bottetourt
and Earl of Falmouth, 17th March, 16th Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 1664.
He was slain in the Dutch wars 1665, without legitimate
issue, and gave for his arms, Gules, a chevron Ermine,
between ten crosses patée, 6 and 4, Argent.</p>

<p>Afterwards it became the honorary title of George Fitz-Roy,
third son of Barbara Duchess of Cleveland by King
Charles the Second, by whom he was created Earl of
Northumberland, Viscount Falmouth, and Baron Pontefract
in Yorkshire; and giveth for his arms, the imperial
shield of England, with a baton sinister, gobonée, Ermine
and Azure. This Barbara Villiers was one of the daughters
of the Lord Viscount Grandison, of the Kingdom of Ireland,
and was married to Roger Palmer, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> created Earl
of Castlemaine, in Ireland; but afterwards, when Charles
the Second took a liking to this Countess, he sent the Earl
her husband, with his own good liking, Governor of a
Castle and Colony of the English at Surat, in the East
Indies. His lady King Charles further created Countess
of Southampton and Duchess of Cleveland, during life.
After the death of George Fitz-Roy, in the year 1722,
Hugh Boscawen, of Tregothnan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Lord Warden of
the Stannaries, was created by King George, Lord Boscawen
of Tregothnan, Baron Boscawen of Boscawen Ros,
in Burian, and Viscount Falmouth.</p>

<p>In this parish, on the lands of the manor of Arwynick
(the Icta and Island of Diodorus Siculus aforesaid), upon
<!--016.png--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
a lofty peninsula or promontory of land, stands the famous
and impregnable Castle of Pendennis, for which the Crown
pays annually to the lord of the manor aforesaid, out of the
Exchequer, about 13<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> rent, as I take it. For the
compound name Pen-den-is Castle, it is British, and signifies
that it is the head or chief man’s castle, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the King
or Earl of Cornwall. Otherwise, if the true name thereof
be Pen-dun-es Castle, it signifies that it is the head or
chief fort or fortress castle. This castle of old consisted
only of a treble intrenchment of turf, earth, and stones,
after the British and Roman manner, upon the top of the
highest hill in those parts, abutting upon the west side of
the mouth or entrance of the harbour of Falmouth, and
containeth about twenty statute acres of ground within the
lines. Repaired and indifferently fortified by Henry the
Eighth, in the latter end of his reign, in the French war,
with allowance of a petty garrison, whose daughter, Queen
Elizabeth, in her Spanish wars, raised the new fort, and
bettered the old fortification, as they are now extant; so
that it is looked upon as one of the most invincible castles
in this kingdom, having had in it above one hundred pieces
of cannon mounted, and some thousands of foot arms.
After Queen Elizabeth had thus fortified and munified the
Castle of Pendennis, she placed therein a band of 100
soldiers, and over them placed as her Governor Sir Nicholas
Parker, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> (a Devonshire gentleman, as some say,
though his arms, a fess fretty or chequey,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> differs from the
arms of Parker of Burrington,) of whom thus speaks Mr.
Carew in his Cornish Survey, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 150: “He now demeaneth
himself no less kindly and frankly towards his neighbours
for the present, than he did resolutely and valiantly
against his enemies when he followed the wars, where-through
he commandeth not only their bodies by his authority,
<!--017.png--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
but also their hearts by his love, to live and die in his
assistance, for their common preservation and her Highness’
service.” He died without issue, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1608,
and lies buried in Budock church. His successor in the
government of this castle was Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongollan,
<abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> (a domestic servant to Prince Henry, eldest
son of James the First,) son of John Hals, of Efford, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
in Devon, who died Governor thereof in 1637; and was
succeeded in that dominion by Sir Nicholas Slanning,
of Marstow, in Devon, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> who was slain on the part of
his master Charles the First against the Parliament army
at the battle of Bristol, 6th July, 1643. After his death his
widow (daughter of Sir James Baggs, of Plymouth, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr>)
was married to Richard Arundell, of Trerice, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> son of
John Arundell, of that place, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> commonly called John
of Tilbury, for that he was an officer under Queen Elizabeth
when she was encamped there with her army, in expectation
of the Spaniards landing, 1588.</p>

<p>Which gentleman, (John Arundell,) was by Charles the
First made Governor of Pendennis Castle; during whose
command there happened a tragical siege thereof by the
Parliament army under Colonel Fortescue; wherein the
besiegers and the besieged showed unparalleled valour and
conduct for about six months’ space, when at length it was
surrendered upon honourable conditions, the soldiers going
forth with their arms mounted and colours flying, more
consumed with sickness and famine within the walls than
destroyed by their enemies from without, having been
driven to that extremity that the governor, soldiers, and
many other gentlemen and ladies therein, were forced
for some time to eat horseflesh, for want of other victuals;
as being hemmed in by the Parliament frigates at sea on
the one side, and surrounded with their army at land on
the other, so that no relief of men or provisions could be
brought into the garrison, whereby it was forced to capitulate
and surrender as aforesaid 1647, (before which time
all other castles in England, except Ragland in Wales,
<!--018.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
were yielded up to the Parliament,) and the hunger-starved
soldiers of Pendennis, that came out thence, feeding too
freely on victuals and drink, brought themselves into incurable
diseases, whereof many died; so that here, as in
many other places, it was observed that more men and
women died by two frequently putting their hands to their
mouths, than by clapping their hands to their swords; as
the Jews did on surrender of Jerusalem to the Romans,
after the siege and famine there.</p>

<p>After the surrender of this castle, as aforesaid, by Colonel
John Arundell, he was succeeded in that dignity by
Colonel Fortescue, and he was succeeded by Captain Fox;
as after the restoration of Charles the Second, Fox was
succeeded by Richard Lord Arundell, and he by the Earl
of Bath.</p>

<p>One Mr. Thomas Killigrew, of this Arwinick family,
was Jester or Master of the Revels to Charles the Second,
who, (to give but a single instance of his wit and humour,)
having been at Paris on business, went to Versailles to see
the French Court for diversion; where, being well known
to many French courtiers who had been in England, he
was by them introduced into Louis the Fourteenth the
King of France’s presence, who had a long time had a
desire to see him whom fame reported the wittiest man in
England. But at that time Killigrew was politically out of
humour, and spoke very little, out of a desire he had to
hear the wisdom of the French Court, and what little discourse
he had it was trivial and of no consequence; whereupon
King Louis told the noblemen that gave him such
encomiums of his wit, that he looked upon him as a very
dull fellow. Whereupon the courtiers told him, notwithstanding
what his Majesty’s opinion was, assuredly he was
a most ingenious and witty man. Whereupon, soon after,
the King resolved to make a further trial of him, and
therefore led him into a long gallery, where were many
fine pictures, and asked Killigrew what they were? And
amongst the rest of those draughts showed the picture of
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
our Saviour upon the Cross; and then again asked Killigrew
if he knew what it was? To which, as to the former
demands, he pleaded ignorance, and answered, “No.”
“Why, then,” said King Louis, “Monsieur Killigrew,
“I will tell you what they are. The picture in the centre
is the draught of our Saviour on the Cross, and that on the
right hand of him is the Pope’s picture, and that on the
left hand of him is my own.” To which Killigrew replied,
“I humbly thank your Majesty for the information you
have given me, for though I have often heard that our
Saviour was crucified between two thieves, yet I never
knew who they were till now.” Which sharp repartee
convinced that King of his wrong opinion of Killigrew’s
wit in satire and ridicule, especially it being at the time
when the Pope and French King grievously persecuted
the French Protestants, and either dragooned them to
mass or drove them out of France.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Killigrew is further said to have put under
the candlestick where Charles the Second supped, five
small papers, on which he had written the word <span class="muchsmaller">ALL</span>. The
King, on sight thereof, asked him what he meant by these
five words of one signification. “Your Majesty’s pardon
granted, I will tell you, sir,” said Mr. Killigrew; which
being promised, he said, “The first All signified that the
Country had sent all; the second, the City had lent all;
the third, that the Court had spent all; the fourth, if we
did not mend all; the fifth, that it will be worse for
us all.”</p>

<p>This was reflected on the royal family of William the
Third, “That he was William Think-all; his Queen Mary,
Mary Take-all; Prince George of Denmark, George
Drink-all; and the Princess Ann, Ann Eat-all, which ill
habit diminished her health and hastened her death.”</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Killigrew, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> married Katherine, the second
daughter and coheir of Sir Anthony Cooke, of Giddy Hall,
<!--020.png--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
in Essex. Her other sisters married Sir William Cecil,
Lord Treasurer, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Chancellor, Sir
Thomas Hobby, and Sir Ralph Howlet, Knts. Which
ladies were all accounted of the most learned in the kingdom,
eminently skilled in the Latin and Greek tongues.
To give an instance for the whole:</p>

<p>Sir Henry Killigrew being appointed by Queen Elizabeth,
ambassador to Henry the Fourth of France, lately
turned Papist, was not very fond of that employment, and
would have excused himself, but knew not how: whereupon
his lady wrote a letter to her sister Mildred, wife to
Sir William Cecil, to try her interest with his lordship to
get the Queen to excuse him, and that some other person
might be appointed for that employment. The letter was
these words:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">Si mihi quem cupio cures, Mildreda! remitti,</div>
  <div class="i2">Tu mihi, tu melior, tu mihi sola soror;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sin male cunctando retines, vel trans mare mittes,</div>
  <div class="i2">Tu mala, tu pejor, tu mihi nulla soror:</div>
  <div class="i0">It si Cornubiam, tibi pax sit, et omnia læta,</div>
  <div class="i2">Sin mare&mdash;Cœcile! nuncio bella.&mdash;Vale!</div>
</div>

<p>Which I find thus translated by Dr. Fuller, in his Worthies,
though much abated of their elegancy in Latin:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">If, Mildred! by thy care he be sent back, whom I request.</div>
  <div class="i2">A sister good thou art to me, yea better, yea the best;</div>
  <div class="i0">But if with stays thou keep’st him still, or send’st where seas may part,</div>
  <div class="i2">Then unto me a sister ill, yea worse, yea none thou art;</div>
  <div class="i0">If go to Cornwall he shall please, I peace to thee foretell;</div>
  <div class="i2">But, Cecil! if he set to seas&mdash;I war denounce.&mdash;Farewell!</div>
</div>

<p>Whether this letter did procure Sir Henry Killigrew’s
stay, and dismission from the intended service, I am unable
to resolve, although well assured I am that his daughter by
this Catherine Cooke was married to Sir Jonathan Trelawney,
of Poole, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 36th <abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr></p>

<p>As for the harbour itself, it is agreed by all mariners to
be one of the best for safe anchorage, large circumference,
and good riding for ships, that this kingdom affords. The
<!--021.png--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
mouth or entrance, between the castles of Pendennis and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes, is about two miles over. The body of the harbour,
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes to Falmouth town, is about a league.
From Falmouth to Turner’s Weare, upon the river Vale,
two leagues; from whence an arm of it goes up towards
Tregony, another towards Tresilian Bridge, a third towards
Truro; all which places the salt water visits every
tide. Beneath Turner’s Weare, on the north, another
channel goes by Restrongar Passage to Carnen, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Perron Arworthal. From Falmouth town goeth up another
creek to Penryn. Lastly, on the south there go into
the country two creeks towards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony.
All these members or branches of the harbour are
overlooked by lofty and pleasant hills, and are supplied with
deep water, so that boats, ships, barges, and lighters every
day, one where or another, carry and recarry goods and merchandizes
to the remotest parts thereof. Hence it is that
Mr. Carew says, “a hundred sail of ships may lie at
anchor within the harbour of Falmouth, and none of them
see the other’s topmast,” because of the steep hills and
windings of the river.</p>

<p>The Killigrews are also lords of the land whereon the
Castle of Pendennis stands, and receive yearly out of the
Exchequer for the same 13<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> Of all which premises
take the following rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">In the calm south great Falmouth’s Harbour stands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where Vale with Sea doth join its peaceful hands;</div>
  <div class="i0a">’Twixt whom to ships commodious port is shown,</div>
  <div class="i0">That makes the riches of the world its own.</div>
  <div class="i0">Falmouth, or Vale, the Britons’ chiefest pride,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glory of them and all the world beside,</div>
  <div class="i0">In sending round the treasures of her tide,</div>
  <div class="i0">Killigrew’s the Lord both of the Fort and Town:</div>
  <div class="i0">Speak these the rest, to make them better known.</div>
</div>

<p>Arwinick signifies upon the marsh; ar being the same
as war, upon, and winick, a marsh, exactly suitable to the
situation of the place.</p>

<p>Sir John Killigrew, of this place, ought not to be forgotten;
who, seeing the Parliament Army to prevail every
<!--022.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
where, with his own hands set fire to his noble house here,
that they might not find shelter in it when they came to lay
siege to Pendennis Castle, as they did soon after: an action
which was well rewarded by Charles the Second; although
the house hath not been rebuilt, a few rooms only having
been fitted up just to receive the family, who have not
much resided in it ever since.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Falmouth Harbour, situated within thirty miles of the
Land’s End, is without all comparison the most advantageous
station for packets, maintaining a regular communication
with Lisbon, the West Indies, and the Mediterranean.
It has also been found admirably adapted for receiving
smaller ships of war; a squadron of frigates, under the
command of Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour, of Admiral
Pellew, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> cruised from hence against the French during
a part of the great contest following the Revolution; but,
although the largest ship may enter the port, and anchor
there in safety, yet it is very inferior for their accommodation
either to Plymouth or to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Falmouth is also a great resort of vessels coming from
foreign countries, to receive orders as to their ultimate destination;
and this is not only owing to the western situation
of the harbour, but, in a very considerable degree, to
the residence of a family which has maintained the highest
reputation through a long series of years, as merchants, as
men of integrity and of talent. They are said to be lineal
or collateral relatives of the patriarch George Fox. On
their first arrival in Cornwall, this family settled themselves
at Par, near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell; but afterwards removing to
Falmouth, they have mainly contributed towards the prosperity
of the whole county, as merchants, as manufacturers,
as spirited and enlightened adventurers in mines,
and in the fisheries. Among many so eminent, it would
be absolute injustice not to mention particularly Mr. Robert
Ware Fox, who has most successfully employed his
<!--023.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
leisure in the philosophical investigation of geology and
of chemistry, in connexion with mechanics, not only by his
own exertions, but as the judicious and liberal encourager
of similar pursuits in others.</p>

<p>Many individuals have acquired wealth in Falmouth by
a very peculiar species of commerce, carried on with Lisbon
by means of the packets. The interchange of various
commodities was legally prohibited, but at the same time
practically allowed, by both Governments; and to such an
extent did this half-contraband trade arise, that a Mr.
Nowell, who kept a retail shop at Falmouth, is said to have
made a fortune, by which his son became Sheriff of the
county in 1787, chiefly as a carrier of these goods to and
from London on packhorses; and a fortune still larger has
been made by Mr. Russell, of Exeter, by conveying increased
quantities in waggons over improved roads, through
Devonshire and Cornwall.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible for such an harbour as Falmouth
to have escaped the knowledge of the Phœnicians, when
they came to Cornwall for tin, and strangely mistook it for
a cluster of islands. The Greeks must also have known
this port; and the Romans not merely encamped in various
parts of the county, but having fixed stations within it,
and on the very banks of the Fall, cannot have failed of
noticing the longest and best roadsted and navigable river
within the limits of Cornwall: but so vague and uncertain
are all the descriptions transmitted to us either by geographers
or by the writers of itineraries, that we are utterly
unable to discriminate most places within certain limits of
each other except by conjecture. It is truly a matter of
astonishment that nations having made such ample progress
in abstract geometry, and in astronomy itself, should have
altogether disregarded latitudes which were within their
reach; and even approximations towards longitudes, which
might have been obtained through the medium of lunar
eclipses.</p>

<p><!--024.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
Various names derived from ancient authors have been
applied to Falmouth. <span class="sc">Valuba</span> is the one most commonly
received. The Ocrinum promontory being taken for the
Lizard, and Bolerium for the Land’s End.</p>

<p>The late Sir Christopher Hawkins seems to have established,
with the full degree of certainty applicable to such
subjects, that the <span class="sc">Ictis</span> of Diodorus Siculus must have
been <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, and not the hill occupied by
Pendennis Castle.</p>

<p>The British name of Falmouth was Smithick. The last
syllable, ick, has doubtlessly some reference to water.</p>

<p>The few houses standing at Smithick before Mr. Killigrew
built the new town, are said to have been called Pen-y-cum-quick;
and an idle story is related of some old
woman having brewed ale for a public meeting, and having
apologized to the people when they assembled for all her
stock being gone, by stating that foreign sailors coming to
her house drunk the whole, and that “Pennies came so
quick” she could not resist the temptation for parting with it.</p>

<p>But the Right <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr >Charles Williams Wynn, <abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr> for
Denbighshire, has informed me that Pen-y-cwm-cuick is, in
good Welch, the head of the contracted valley or dingle.
Cuch signifies contracted, or knit together, as knitting the
brows. This corresponds with the valley going up from the
strand by the new market-house. Sir George Clark’s seat,
near Edinburgh, situated in a similar manner in respect
to a narrow vale, is written Pen-y-cuick, and pronounced
Pennyquick, the Celtic <span class="muchsmaller">PEN-Y</span> being always corrupted by
Saxon lips into penny; as Pen-y-darran, on the Taff.</p>

<p>The church at Falmouth is dedicated to King Charles the
First, with the proud additions of Saint and Martyr. It
evidently suited with the views and with the interest of
those in power after 1660, to identify Charles the First
with the Established Church, and to inculcate that he died
in its defence. The new church at Plymouth is dedicated
in a similar manner to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles; and in this instance
<!--025.png--><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
the pleasure of outraging the feelings of their adversaries
may have acted in aid of political expediency.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals does not seem to have treated the very distinguished
family of Killigrew in a manner that might have
been expected, from his attachment to aristocracy in general,
or from his prejudices as a Cavalier. The horrible
story of Jane Killigrew cannot possibly be true, in the
manner or to the extent in which it is related, and the
whole should have been omitted, were there not reasons for
believing that it rests on some foundation.</p>

<p>If the lady is exonerated from the most atrocious part of
the tale, representing her as actually boarding the vessels
and participating in the destruction of foreign merchants,
and for which mere popular tradition at the interval of two
centuries cannot form an adequate proof, we must not too
rigidly apply the manners and feelings of our own times to
a period so dissimilar. Many exploits performed by the
great Sir Francis Drake, would now create very different
impressions from those stamped on men’s minds at the
time; and the more gentle and courteous, though not less
brave, Sir Walter Raleigh, would now hardly escape without
blame.</p>

<p>No one seems to have suffered greater degradation, from
common report, than Mr. Thomas Killigrew. He is usually
represented as the Jester, or even licensed fool, of
Charles the Second; and the anecdotes given by Mr. Hals
contain much more of rudeness than of wit.</p>

<p>His history is thus related in the Biographical Dictionary
of 1784:</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Thomas Killigrew</span>, descended from the ancient Cornish
family of that name, was a younger son of Sir Robert
Killigrew, and born in 1611. He was distinguished by
uncommon abilities. He was page of honour to King
Charles the First, and groom of the bedchamber to King
Charles the Second, with whom he had suffered many years
of exile. During his abode beyond the sea, he took a view
of France, Italy, and Spain, and was honoured by his Majesty
<!--026.png--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
with the employment of Resident at the State of
Venice. In his absence from this country he applied his
leisure hours to poetry, and to the composition of several
plays, of which Sir John Denham takes notice in his poem
on our author’s return from his embassy. Though Denham
mentions but six, our author wrote nine plays in his
travels, and two at London; all which were printed, with
his picture before them, in 1664. There is, besides, “A
Letter concerning some Nuns in the Nunnery of Tours,”
dated from Orleans in 1635, and printed in three folio
sheets. Mr. Killigrew died in 1682, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey. He had been twice married.</p>

<p>“He was a man of a very droll and uncommon vein of
humour, with which he used to divert that merry monarch
Charles the Second; who on that account was fonder of
him than his best Ministers, and would give him access to
his person when he denied it to them.” It was usually said
of him, that when he attempted to write he was nothing
near so smart as he was in conversation: which was just
the reverse of Cowley, who shone but little in conversation,
although he excelled so much with his pen. Hence Denham,
who knew them both, has taken occasion thus to characterize
their respective excellences and defects:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">“Had Cowley ne’er spoke, Killigrew ne’er writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">Combin’d in one, they’d make a matchless wit.”</div>
</div>

<p>Another brother, Henry Killigrew, is mentioned in the
same work, Chaplain to James the Second while he was
Duke of York, and a Prebendary of Westminster. He is
there stated to have written a tragedy at the age of seventeen,
called “The Conspiracy,” which obtained the high
approbation of Ben Jonson.</p>

<p>He had a daughter, Ann Killigrew, recorded as</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">A Grace for beauty, and a Muse for wit.</div>
</div>

<p>This young lady was maid of honour to the Duchess of
York, but died of the smallpox at the early age of twenty-five.</p>

<p><!--027.png--><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
The elder brother, William, was also a poet and an
author. The representative of the Killigrew family is Lord
Wodehouse, in right of his late wife, Sophia Berkeley,
niece of Lord Berkeley of Stratton.</p>

<p>Falmouth has now outgrown the property of those who
originally built the town, and is extended northward, at
Green Bank, into the land of Lord de Dunstanville, where
the houses have all the convenience and decoration suited
to modern times. The older part of Falmouth, although
it dates no further back than about two centuries, is unfortunately
distinguished by its narrow, crooked streets,
and by every defect usually found in the smallest fishing-towns.
It is, however, surrounded by beautiful villas.</p>

<p>Falmouth has been associated, in 1832, with Penryn, in
the privilege of sending two Members to Parliament.</p>

north <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kea, east and south the harbour of Falmouth towards
the Vale river, west Restrongat creek, or Carnan

it signifies the top of a house, or high mountain, as this
parish is on, and there is still extant the lofty local place
called Le Feock, Le Feage. At the time of the Domesday
Tax, 20th William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> (1087), this parish was taxed by
the name of Ros-carnon, now part thereof. In the Inquisition

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Feock, the presidual guardian of this church, in all
probability lived at the local place aforesaid, called Le-Feock,
i. e. Feock’s place and dwelling; but who or what
his parents were, when or where born, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> I must plead
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non sum informatus</i>.</p>

<p>In the glass windows is the figure of a man in priest’s
robes, with a radiated or shining circle about his head and
face, and under his feet written <span class="sc"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Feock</span>; beneath whom,
<!--029.png--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
also in the glass, were painted, kneeling and bending forward,
in way of adoration, the figures of a man and woman,
and behind them several children, out of which figurative
man and woman’s mouths proceeded a label, with this inscription&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sancte
Feock, ora pro bono statu S. Trewonwoll
et Elionoræ uxoris ejus.”</span> From whence I was fully
satisfied that he was indeed the tutelar guardian of this
church.</p>

<p>At Le-Feock aforesaid, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was the dwelling,
by lease, of Captain Thomas Penrose, whose father
married Verman; originally descended from the Penroses
of Penrose in Sythney. This gentleman having in his
youth, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> been bred at sea, in the study and
practice of the art of navigation, it appears from his journal
that, in the year 1650, he was by the Admiral of the
States of England made Captain or Commander of the
Bristol frigate or man-of-war, in which he fought, together
with the English fleet under command of General Blake,
near Dover, against the Dutch fleet, under their General
Van Tromp, who was shrewdly worsted by Blake. He was
also in the engagement against the Dutch fleet under Sir
George Ayscough, 1652, before Plymouth, where the
victory inclined to neither side, but great losses on both.
He also, 28th of October, the same year, fought in General
Blake’s squadron against the General of the States De
Witt, who was then worsted, on one side of the North
Foreland, in the Downs. Captain Penrose was also in
that engagement between General Blake and Van Tromp
wherein the English Fleet was worsted, and came off with
great loss, so that Van Tromp sailed into the Downs in
great triumph, with a broom on his main-topmast.</p>

<p>But, maugre his success, pride, and insolence, the States
of England fitted forth their shattered ships sooner than
was expected, to the number of eighty sail of men-of-war,
when Captain Penrose was removed from the Bristol to
the command of the Maidstone frigate. Then also were
Penn and Burne discharged from command of particular
<!--030.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
squadrons, and the supreme command of the fleet was put
into the hands of General Blake, General Monk, and
General Dean; when soon after happened that bloody and
tremendous sea-fight betwixt the English and the Dutch
fleets, before Weymouth and Dungeness, wherein General
Monk declared (upon the sudden death of General Dean,
killed at breakfast on the deck of their ship by Monk’s
side, with a defiance gun-bullet shot at random by the
Dutch to his destruction) that this fifth battle should put
an end to the war one way or other, and gave forth strict
order and command to the officers of the English fleet upon
penalty of death, that they should neither take from nor
give quarter to the enemy; which commands in the engagement
being for a considerable time kept and observed by
the English, the terror thereof so amazed the Dutch, that,
after great losses of men and ships by them sustained, they
declined to fight, and bore or ran away with their fleet,
leaving the victory and British Channel wholly to the
English fleet. In this fight, as appears from Penrose’s
Journal, he lost above fifty men out of the Maidstone,
besides had many more wounded. Afterwards the English
fleet, coasting westwards in pursuit of the vanquished
Dutch fleet, were by cross winds forced into Falmouth
harbour, where also for some days, as appears from Penrose’s
Journal aforesaid, he entertained at his house in this
place of Le-Feock (opposite the harbour aforesaid) General
Monk, General Blake, Sir George Ayscough, and
many other officers and gentlemen of the fleet, to good
content and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Afterwards they sent him many letters concerning the
war, fleet, and ship he sailed in, and the course he should
take; and in particular, amongst others, thanked him for
his great valour and conduct in the several engagements
aforesaid. From some of which it appears General Blake
was a better soldier than scholar, as being very badly able
to write the letters of his name to the letters his secretary
had formed, as yet may be seen; which is not to be wondered
<!--031.png--><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
at, as I am credibly informed he was at first but a
man of no higher education than that of a petty mechanic,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a ribbon and galloon weaver in Taunton; whereof, at
last, for his valour in the siege, in opposition to Charles
the First, he was made governor thereof by the Parliament.</p>

<p>Captain Penrose fought also in the Maidstone frigate
under General Monk, in the sixth and last engagement of
the English at sea against the Dutch fleet, wherein Van
Tromp their general was slain, and his fleet extremely
shattered, sunk, and disabled, to the great terror of the
United Provinces. Then also the Maidstone frigate underwent
the loss of many seamen; and the Captain continued
his post till the restoration of Charles the Second,
when he was dismissed from his command, and another
commander placed in his room; after which he retired to
his country-house of Le-Feock aforesaid.</p>

<p>It also appears from Penrose’s Journal whilst he commanded
the Maidstone, that she was one of the five ships
under Sir George Ayscough that was ordered by the then
Parliament of England to sail into the Sound, or German
Sea, to assist the King of Sweden against the Danes. But
a peace being concluded betwixt those nations, soon after
the arrival of those ships, nothing of action was performed
by them. Nevertheless, the King of Sweden rewarded the
five captains of those ships in this expedition, with so many
medals and neck-chains of gold, with the King of Sweden’s
face on one side of the medal, and the several arms of those
gentlemen on the other, weighing about eighteen ounces
each together with the chain. Penrose’s medal is yet to be
seen with his daughter.</p>

<p>In the year 1664, when another Dutch and French war
broke out between them and Charles the Second, and able
sea-officers were wanted for the fleet, Penrose (who as
aforesaid for several years had been displaced) had divers
letters sent to him from James Duke of York, and the
Duke of Albemarle (formerly General Monk), by order of
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
Charles the Second, requesting in this time of need that he
would come up to London, accept of the command, and
take the charge of the Monk frigate, in the Dutch war;
which at length with some reluctance he accepted. In
which post he discharged the place with such care and
faithfulness as before he had done in the Parliament service.
And, moreover, in the three sea-fights which the
Duke of York and the Duke of Albemarle had with the
Dutch fleets, (in all which he was commanded, though
but a third-rate ship, to follow the admiral or general’s
ships,) he behaved himself with such prudent valour and
conduct (though with the loss of several hundreds of his
men) that he preserved his ship, to the admiration of all
that saw her, from destruction, though often boarded and
surrounded with enemies.</p>

<p>In brief, those matters are so abundantly set forth in the
several letters of thanks, after those engagements, from the
said Dukes and their Secretaries to Penrose, that if I
should take the pains to transcribe them, they would only
be thought a romance, as containing in them almost unparallelled
adventures and dangers, which he most valiantly
and successfully passed through, in the midst of seas,
slaughter, fire, and bullets, were not the originals yet extant,
and to be seen.</p>

<p>Lastly, it appears from letters, and his Journal, which
he kept daily for eighteen years’ space, which he spent at
sea in the public service of his country, that in the year
1667 he was by Charles the Second made Admiral of a
squadron of ships of sixteen men-of-war, which were ordered
to cruise between Harwich and Newcastle towards
the coasts of Holland, to watch the motion of the enemy.
Where he received many letters by King Charles’s order
from the Secretaries of State, War, and Admiralty, as also
from the Dukes aforesaid (yet to be seen), containing
thanks for his good service, and further desiring the continuance
of his care, conduct, and watchfulness against the
enemy, whensoever they should put out to sea again: in
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
the mean time to observe such further orders as should be
sent him.</p>

<p>In this kind of post he remained till his death, 1669,
King Charles then owing him for his salary or pay above
1,500<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> of which neither he nor his heir or executor ever
received a farthing. His death was thought to be hastened
through grief and vexation (being scarcely fifty-six years
old when he died), and the occasion thus:&mdash;His ship, the
Monk, being all manned with Cornish men in those three
last engagements with the Dutch, who for the love and
respect they bore him, their countryman, were all volunteers
without being impressed for the public service; now
it happened that, in the year 1668, peace being concluded
betwixt King Charles and the States of Holland, the
greatest part of our English fleet were hauled up, the officers,
seamen, and soldiers disbanded, without satisfaction,
wages, or pay for their service; and amongst them Captain
Penrose’s ship and squadron underwent the same fate. So
that soon after, he happening to be at London upon some
occasions, his disbanded company of Cornish men from the
Monk, being far from home, were very troublesome and
tumultuous with him about their pay, and so clamorous as
to tell him that he, by his fair promises, had cajoled them
into the public service, and that now they could get nothing
for their labour and the hazard of their lives.</p>

<p>The Captain answered for himself, as well as he could,
that it was his own case, as well as many other officers’ and
theirs, at this exigence to want his money, and therefore
desired their patience till the King was better provided
with cash for their satisfaction. But the Cornish men
being more and more dissatisfied with him by those delays,
and their wants and necessities pressing hard upon them,
they formed a petition, setting forth the premises, to his
Majesty, and with the same came to the Captain’s chamber,
and endeavoured (after words would not prevail) to
constrain or compel him in person to present it to the
King’s Majesty, which he refusing to undertake, a scuffle
<!--034.png--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
happened at the top of the stairs between him and the petitioners;
in which conflict one Lampeer, of Truro, by
thrust of Penrose’s hands, his feet and hands failing, was
thrown over the stairs, and so much bruised with the fall
that soon after he died.</p>

<p>Whereupon Penrose was apprehended, held upon bail,
and afterwards indicted before the grand jury of Middlesex
or Westminster, and found guilty of murder or manslaughter,
and afterwards was tried for his life, and by the
grand and petty jury found guilty of manslaughter: that is
to say, the unlawful killing of a man without premeditated
malice, (which is felony, because wilful&mdash;but admits of
the benefit of clergy for the first crime,) whereupon Penrose
was condemned to death, and put into Newgate, where
forthwith he received a reprieve or pardon of this offence
from Charles the Second, under the broad seal of England,
yet to be seen. Nevertheless, for the drawing, sealing, or
procuring this pardon, the clerks and officers through
whose hands it passed extorted from the Captain 200<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> before
he could get out of their hands to show it to the Sheriff
of Middlesex.</p>

<p>This unhappy accident so troubled Penrose, that, to put
off the thoughts thereof, he kept company more than ordinary
with gentlemen and officers of the fleet and others; so
that at length, by excess of drinking healths, and otherwise,
he fell into a malignant fever, whereof he died, leaving
issue one only daughter, his heir, named Martha, married
to James Hals, of Merther, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr></p>

<p>Tre-gew, alias Tregue, in this parish, synonymous words,
signifying the spear or javelin town, is the dwelling of
Henry Edmunds, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> originally descended from the
Edmunds of Middlesex, whose ancestor, being a person
well qualified for the purpose, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> was sent
from London by the Company of Pewterers to inspect and
try the Cornish tin, then corrupted by the blowers thereof,
before it was coined, that so the bad metal might be examined
and taxed before it was coined, proportionable to
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
the badness. In which assay-master’s office he thrived so
well, that at length he became a tin-factor himself, grew
rich, and bought this place, and other lands near, as also
the manor of Truro, of Sir Bevill Grenvill, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> But he
and his security failing in paying the consideration money,
he was cast into prison, where he died without further satisfation
to his said creditor; notwithstanding which, those
lands descended to his heir, now in possession thereof, except
the manor of Truro, sold to Samuel Enys, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>The Cornish tongue was retained in this parish by the
old inhabitants thereof, till about the year 1640. Mr.
William Jackman, then Vicar thereof, Chaplain of Pendennis
Castle, at the siege thereof by the Parliament Army,
was forced for divers years to administer the Sacrament to
the communicants in the Cornish tongue, because the aged
people did not well understand the English, as himself
often told me. Now because it may not be unacceptable
to the curious to know the Cornish words then used in
administering the bread and wine to the communicants, I
will here set them down, for their satisfaction:</p>

<p>Mr. John Lanyon, of this parish, a sea sand-barge daily

<p>Mr. Tonkin does not make any addition to the history
of this parish, except by stating that James Hals, who
married Martha Penrose, the only child of Captain Thomas
Penrose, was “an elder brother of the author; and that
their eldest son, then about fourteen years of age, was
engaged in the pursuit of his grandfather’s profession, by
serving as one of the King’s scholars, or gentlemen volunteers,
on board the Sunderland, Captain Tudor Trevor

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Trelisick is now the most splendid feature of this parish.
The situation, beautiful in all other respects, commands a
view of the whole inland sea constituting Falmouth Harbour.
The House was built about the middle of the last
century, by Mr. John Laurence, a captain in the county
militia, during the Seven Years’ War, still remembered
for his good-nature, convivial habits, and wild eccentricities.
It is perhaps deserving of notice that the architect was Mr.
Davy, grandfather of the celebrated chemist.</p>

<p><!--037.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
The property became divided on Mr. Laurence’s decease;
and it was purchased, about the year 1800, by the
late Mr. Ralph Allen Daniell; other lands were added to the
domain, and the whole became a handsome seat suited to
the natural advantages of the place.</p>

<p>Still further additions and decorations have been made
by his son, Mr. Thomas Daniell; but this gentleman
choosing to quit Cornwall, has sold the whole to Lord Falmouth,
the proprietor of Tregothnan, a still more magnificent
seat, and removed from Trelisick only a few miles
further up on the Truro river.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Daniell, the grandfather, was chief clerk to
Mr. Lemon, and having married Miss Elliott, niece of
Mr. Allen, of Bath, he found himself enabled to take the
whole of Mr. Lemon’s great concerns off the hands of his
executors in 1760; and soon after to build the house in
Truro, remarkable not only on account of its being the
largest and most decorated mansion in that very splendid
town, but as being constructed of Bath Oolite, the gift of
Mr. Allen, from Prior Park.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniell continued throughout his whole life to conduct
most extensive concerns as a general merchant, as
a tin smelter, and, above all, as a spirited adventurer in
mines on the largest scale. He left one son and one
daughter.</p>

<p>The daughter married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Napleton, a dignitary
in the church of Hereford, and previously tutor at
Brasenose college, Oxford; where he is well known as the
author of a work (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Elementa Logicæ, subjicitur Appendix
de Usu Logicæ et Conspectus Organi Aristotelis”</span>) which
has been adopted into the lectures of every college throughout
the University. The son, Mr. Ralph Allen Daniell,
continued most of his father’s concerns, adding to them a
large smelting-work for copper in Glamorganshire; and so
successful were his mining speculations, that he is said to
have gained, in the course of a very few years, above a hundred
and fifty thousand pounds from Wheal Tower alone.</p>

<p><!--038.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
Mr. Daniell was twice Member for West Looe. He
married the only daughter of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Pooley, Rector
of Ladock, and has left a numerous family. His eldest
son has married Miss Osbaldeston, and they have several
children.</p>

<p>Killiganoon, probably the grove by the downs, is next to
be noticed in Feock.</p>

<p>The place was entirely created by Mr. Richard Hussey.
This gentleman was the son of an attorney at Truro, who
died insolvent, leaving a widow with one son, and three or
four daughters. The son is represented to have exerted
himself with efforts proportional to the embarrassments in
which he found the affairs of his family, and he became in
consequence one of the most distinguished lawyers of the
time. He had the honour of being appointed Attorney
General to the Queen; and he was Counsel to the East
India Company, and Member of Parliament, I believe, for
Michael. Mr. Hussey died in the year 1770, under sixty,
and divided his fortune among his sisters. One had married
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Vivian, and her grandson is the distinguished
officer, General Sir Hussey Vivian. Another sister
married Mr. Walker, of Lanlivery, and left an only son,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Walker, Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow. A third
sister married Mr. Ustick, of Penzance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary Hussey, widow of Mr. Hussey of Truro,
married, secondly, Mr. William Davies of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth, a
half-brother of the Editor’s grandfather, where she continued
to reside; and her funeral appears on the parish
register September 18th, 1750.</p>

<p>Killiganeen was sold after Mr. Hussey’s decease, and
passed into the hands of Mr. Dagge. Two brothers of that
name went to London from Bodmin to seek their fortunes.
One became the manager of Covent Garden Theatre; the
other pursued the law, to which both were probably educated,
and ultimately retired to this place. It has since
become the property of Admiral Spry, who improved and
enlarged the house and the plantations; and it belongs at
<!--039.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
this time to his son, Samuel Thomas Spry, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> <abbr title="Member of Parliament">M.P.</abbr> for
Bodmin.</p>

<p>A coarse part of this parish remained uninclosed till
within a few years, and was known by the name of Feock
Downs. The surface appeared to be more smooth and
even than any other piece of open ground in the west of
Cornwall; consequently, when local political dissensions
were at a great height, about sixty years ago, this place
was selected by one party for establishing races, in rivalship
of others conducted by their opponents at Bodmin. These
races fell, however, with the temporary feeling which gave
them birth, and the ground is now inclosed.</p>

<p>A small village in this parish is distinguished by the
name of “Come-to-Good;” a name probably given to it at
first in ridicule, because there was established the earliest
Quakers’ meeting in that part of Cornwall. And, for some
reason now quite forgotten, the first Sunday in August
became designated all over that populous mining district as
“Come-to-Good Sunday,” when several thousand persons
continued to assemble, till the very prudent Society to
whom the house belongs, adopted the expedient of discontinuing
their meeting on that particular day.</p>

<p>This parish measures 2,580 statute acres.</p>

<p>In the ancient chapel at Foy, now the minister’s chancel,
was inscribed <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> the name of Fisart
Bagga, a famous sea commander in the then French wars,
a native of this town of Foy. [Carew’s Survey of Cornwall,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 135.] This church and town I take to be under the
tutelary guardianship of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine, whose history is
misplaced under Lanteagles by Fowey.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hals’s history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine is lost. It may,
therefore, be sufficient to give the following short statement
of her legend.</p>

<p>In the Μηνολογιον, the <cite>Menology</cite>, (the Monthly Register,
synonymous with Martyrology,) of the Emperor Basil, said
to be composed by himself, but certainly written under his
own inspection, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine is stated to have sprung from
one of the families which in those times obtained a transient
possession of the imperial throne.</p>

<p><!--041.png--><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
She was probably born at Alexandria, and suffered
martyrdom there under the reign of Maximus the Second,
about the year 310.</p>

<p>Her learning, abilities, and zeal were so great, that, having
been ordered to dispute with several of the most able
philosophers, she confuted them all, and even converted
some among them to the Christian faith. These new proselytes
are said to have been instantly hurried to the flames,
but that the Saint herself was reserved for a still more cruel
fate, the persecutors of religion having contrived a wheel
set round with hooks and spikes, for the purpose of tearing
and lacerating its victim. The legends, however, go on to
say that this horrible engine was dashed in pieces by angels,
just as the tormentors were about to use it against the
Saint, whom they nevertheless decapitated, unawed by the
recent miracle, and no longer interrupted by any supernatural
interference.</p>

<p>The body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine was found five hundred years
afterwards, when the Saracens had possession of Egypt,
although it is not recorded by whom the discovery was
made, nor how the identity was proved. A subsequent
great event, however, placed that most important circumstance
beyond all doubt; for it having been resolved to
translate the body from the immediate power of the Mahometans
to a monastery built on Mount Sinai by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helena,
and augmented by Justinian, a company of angels,
probably the very same who destroyed the wheel, conveyed
the relics to Mount Sinai through the air.</p>

<p>Some recent martyrologists have endeavoured to explain
away the latter miracle, by asserting that angels meant
monks, who on account of the purity of their morals, the
sanctity of their divine duties, and the eminent utility of
their lives, are frequently confounded with the inhabitants
of heaven.&mdash;It is almost needless to add that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine’s
Wheel has uniformly reference to the intended instrument
of her martyrdom, and never to a spinning-wheel, of which
the Saint is sometimes supposed in England to have been
the inventor. <span class="sc">Editor.</span>]</p>

<p><!--042.png--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
But for the church and tower of Foy, as it now stands,
it was built about the year 1466, towards which Richard
Neville, Earl of Warwick, was a great benefactor; as appears
from his badge, or cognizance, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> ragged staves, yet
to be seen cut in many parts of the stones of the said
church and tower thereof.</p>

<p>The town of Foys is the voke lands of an ancient lordship
by prescription, which the Prior of Tywardreth held
of the ancient Earl of Cornwall’s manor of Pow-vallet-coyt,
now Lostwithiel, or Restormel Castle, under the rent
of &mdash;&mdash;; from whom also they had their privilege
of sending two members to sit in the Commons’ House of
Parliament. It was incorporated by Charles the Second,
by the name of the Mayor, Recorder, Portreeve, eight
Aldermen, and a Town Clerk. Notwithstanding which,
by ancient custom, the members of Parliament were
elected by the freemen, (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> scot and lot men, that pay rates
and taxes) and the precept from the Sheriff for the writ
for election of them must be thus directed: Præposito et
Senescallo Burgi de Foy, in Comitatu Cornubiæ, salutem,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> As also the writ for removing any action at law depending
in Foy court-leet to a superior court, must be
directed to the Portreeve and Town Clerk or Steward.</p>

<p>The arms of this town are, a ship in full course, with
sails expansed, on the waves of the ocean. It is further
privileged with a weekly market on Saturdays, and fairs
annually, on Shrove Tuesday, May 1st, and September 10th.
This town hath also added to its privileges some of the liberties
and freedoms of the Cinque Ports, which other towns
or harbours have not: what they are, the inhabitants there
best know. Those privileges were first granted only to the
ports of Hastings, Hythe, Dover, Romney, and Sandwich, in
Kent, by Edward the Confessor; afterwards much increased
in the days of the three Edwards, the First, Second, and
Third: which in this place are too long for me to recite.
Mr. Carew tells us, that in Edward the Third’s days sixty
tall ships did belong to this harbour; and that the town of
<!--043.png--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
Foys did assist that King with forty-seven sail of men-of-war
and transport-ships, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1347, in order to the
siege of Calais; whereupon that King granted commissions
to the chief commanders of those Foy ships to take French
prizes, during his wars with those people, or French nation;
so that in few years those Foy men were grown so rich and
formidable, by taking French prizes, that by force and
arms they would enter many ports of that kingdom, and
carry with them all ships they could conquer, and what
they could not, would use means to set them on fire in the
places where they lay. In fine, when French prizes grew
scarce, (I speak upon the authority of Mr. Carew,) they
scrupled not to turn sea-robbers, or pirates, taking, plundering,
and destroying all ships they could master, of
what country soever, not sparing the sailors’ lives. By
which means the townsmen grew unspeakably rich and
proud and mischievous, which occasioned the Lord Pomier,
and other Normans, to petition John, King of
France, to grant them a private commission of marque and
arms, to be revenged on the pirates and thieves of Foy
town, which accordingly they obtained, and carried their
design so secretly that a small squadron of ships, and many
bands of marine soldiers, were prepared and shipped without
the Foymen’s knowledge or notice, who accordingly
put to sea out of the river Seine, in the month of July
1457, in 35th Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> and with a fair wind sailed thence
across the British Channel, and got sight of Foy harbour,
where they lay off at sea till night, when they drew towards
the shore and dropped anchor, and in the night landed
their marine soldiers and seamen, and at midnight approached
the south-west end of Foy-town, where they
killed all persons they met with, set fire to the houses, and
burned one half thereof to the ground, to the consumption
of a great part of the inhabitants’ riches and treasures, a
vast deal of which was gotten by their piratical practices;
in which massacre and conflagration, the women, children,
<!--044.png--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
and weakest sort of people, forsook the place, and fled for
safety into the hill country.</p>

<p>But others of the stoutest men, under conduct of John
Treffrye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> fortified themselves as well as they could in
his then new-built house of Plase, yet extant, where they
stoutly opposed the assaults of their enemies; whilst the
French soldiers plundered that part of the town which was
unburned, without opposition, in the dark. The news of
this French invasion in the morning flew far into the county,
and the people of the contiguous parts as quickly put
themselves in arms, and in great multitudes gathered together,
in order to raise the siege of Foy; which the Frenchmen
observing, and fearing the consequence of their longer
stay, having got sufficient treasures to defray the charge of
their expedition, as hastily ran to their ships as they had
deliberately entered the town, and as privately returned
into France as they had clandestinely come into England,
with small profit and less honour.</p>

<p>The town of Foy being thus consumed by fire, and plundered
by the French soldiers and seamen, the inhabitants’
former wealth and glory reduced to poverty and contempt,
they politically cast themselves at the feet of Richard Nevill,
Earl of Warwick (aforesaid), who, pitying their distressed
condition, and being Lord High Admiral of England,
granted some of them new commissions for privateering
and taking French ships, on promise of their just and
righteous proceedings, and renouncing the trade of piracy
(for which reason their former commissions were revoked);
whereupon in few years they plied their sea-business so
effectually, that they increased their riches to such degree
that they began to repair and rebuild their damnified
houses, and in the stones of many of them, in memory of
the Earl of Warwick’s favour and bounty towards them,
there is cut his arms, badge, and cognizance, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>Nevertheless (so hard it is for those to do well who are
accustomed to do evil, as for a blackmoor to wash himself
white) those Foy men, not content with lawful privateering,
<!--045.png--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
fell again to their old trade of piracy, robbing and killing
the seamen of all nations whose ships they could conquer;
of which they were again detected 18th Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> 1478,
who thereupon sent a messenger or serjeant-at-arms to
Foy, to apprehend some of those delinquents, and bring
them up to London to be tried for those crimes, in order
to receive condign punishment. But, instead of obeying
the King’s command and officer, in contempt of his authority
they barbarously cut off his ears, and so dismembered
sent him back to his master King Edward; at which
affront the King was so distasted, that soon after he sent
down Commissioners to Lostwithiel, under pretence of
raising able seamen to go in war against the French, and
that such amongst them as appeared most fit and able
should have command of some of the King’s best ships. At
this news a great part of the freemen and seamen of Foy
were drawn to Lostwithiel; where they no sooner came,
but immediately they were apprehended and taken into
custody for the crimes aforesaid, their ill-gotten goods and
chattels seized by the Sheriff and King’s officers, and one
Harrington, a most notorious pirate, executed; and the
chain of their harbour was removed to Dartmouth. (Carew’s
Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 135.)</p>

<p>The harbour of Foy aboundeth with deep and navigable
waters for ships of the greatest burthen, overlooked with
winding and lofty hills, and, though narrow, extends itself in
several branches three or four miles up the country, and is
navigable to Lanlivery and Lostwithiel, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenow and
Laranbridge, and abounds with all sorts of fish proper to
that country, as salmon, peal, trout, plaice, soal, millet, bass,
eels, congers, pullocks, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> here daily sold at a cheap rate.
At the mouth or entrance of this harbour, are two petty
bulwarks, or blockhouses, the Polman, or Porth-Eran on
the Lanteglos side, the other at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine’s, under Foy
town, most famous for a fight they had with a Dutch man-of-war
of seventy guns, doubly manned, that was sent from
their main fleet of ships of eighty sail, that lay at anchor
<!--046.png--><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
and cruised before this haven, 16th July, 1666, then in
pursuit of our Virginia fleet of eighty sail, which, escaping
their cognizance, safely got some hours before them into
this harbour, and, on notice given of the war, sailed up the
branches thereof as far as they could, and grounded themselves
on the mud lands thereof.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which, this Dutch frigate resolved to
force the two forts or fortresses aforesaid, and to take or
burn our said Virginia fleet. Accordingly, it happened on
that day, a pretty gale of wind blowing, this ship entered
the haven, and as soon as she came within cannon-shot of
those forts, fired her guns upon the two blockhouses with
great rage and violence; and these made them a quick return
of the like compliment or salutation. In fine, the
fight continued for about two hours’ time, in which were
spent some thousands of cannon-shot on both sides, to the
great hurt of the Dutch ship, in plank, rigging, sails, and
men, chiefly because the wind slacked, or turned so adverse,
that she could not pass quick enough between the two forts
up the river, so as to escape their bullets, but lay a long
time a mark for them to shoot at, till she had opportunity
of wind to tack round, turn back, and bear off at sea to
their fleet, to give them an account of her unsuccessful
attempt and great damage as aforesaid, to the no small
credit and reputation of Foy’s little castles, manned out
with gunners and seamen from the ships of the Virginia
fleet for that purpose, who all, by reason of the walls and
intrenchments thereof, were preserved from death, notwithstanding
the continual firing of the cannons of the Dutch
man-of-war upon them; whereby the contiguous lands by
the bullets were ploughed up, to the terror and astonishment
of all beholders.</p>

<p>After this engagement, the cargo of the whole Virginia
fleet was landed at Foy, (its owners at London fearing the
hazard of the sea in time of the Dutch war, to transport it
there by water,) and gave opportunity to the townsmen to
buy much tobacco at a very cheap rate, which instantly, upon
<!--047.png--><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
the conclusion of the peace between England, France, and
Holland, was sold in this kingdom, France, Spain, and
Holland, at a dear rate, and much enriched the townsmen
thereby, as Mr. Major, one of those merchants, informed me.</p>

<p>The chief place in this town is Plase, in British a palace,
which is the dwelling of John Treffrye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> so called from
some of the many local places passing under that denomination
in Cornwall, and compounded of treu or tref frye,
synonymous words, signifying the free or manumitted
town. He was the son of John Treffrye, of Rooke, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
that married Vivian of Truan; the which John Treffrye
succeeded to the patrimony or lands of the Treffrys of this
place, more for similitude of name than consanguinity or
affinity of blood, by the will, devise, or entail of the last
gentleman that died without issue in this house. The present
possessor, as aforesaid, is John Treffrye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> my very
kind friend and kinsman, Member of Parliament for the
town of Foy, whereof comparatively he is lord and high
lord. He married Stephens. His predecessors in this
place were gentlemen of great fame and estates, and have
served their country in the several capacities of Parliament
men for this town, justices of the peace, and sheriffs of
Cornwall; particularly John Treffrye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of
Cornwall 1st Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> 1482. He was a great benefactor
towards building the present church of Foy, as appears
from his arms being cut in divers places of the stones and
tower thereof. Sir John Treffrye, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> (probably his son),
was Sheriff of Cornwall 5th and 15th Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>; William
Treffrye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall 16th Hen. <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1501,
when Richard Whiteleigh, of Efford, was Sheriff of Devon.
The arms of those gentlemen are, Sable, a chevron
between three hawthorns Argent (i. e. summer thorn, hau,
haw, in British is summer).</p>

<p>The chief inhabitants of this town, besides Mr. Treffrye,
are Mr. Pomeroy, Mr. Goodall, Mr. Major, Mr. Toller,
Mr. Tyncombe, and others.</p>

<p>In this town Philip Rashleigh, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
built and endowed a hospital with the garb or tithe sheaf
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
of the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wen for ever, towards the relief of six
poor widow women, two of the said parish and four
from another parish, who receive weekly 15<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> in money,
and suits of apparel yearly, with other privileges, but are
prohibited from begging the country, or any parish stipend.
[See <span class="sc">Tywardreth</span>.]</p>

<p>This gentleman got great riches by trade and merchandize,
and sea adventures; more particularly by a small ship
or frigate, of about eighty tons, bearing about sixteen cannons
or demi-culverins, besides small arms, and 60 men, for
defence thereof; the commander of which ship had a commission
from Queen Elizabeth as a privateer, in her wars
with the Spaniards, to take all Spanish ships it should meet
with at sea, and make them prizes for him, his adventurers,
and the Queen’s advantage, which said privateer, or man-of-war,
was so successful and fortunate in its adventures at
sea for some years, and in traffic, and merchandizes, and
prizes, that those gentlemen accumulated and laid up great
riches thereby; and in remembrance and memory of this
ship, caused the figure in memory of it to be perpetuated
in a small ship, about five feet long, made and
formed by a ship carpenter, of timber, with masts, sails,
ropes, guns, and anchors, and figures of men thereon;
which is hanged up to the roof, or planking, with an iron
chain, in their old house in this town, of which ship those
gentlemen have often given me ocular observation, as well
as told me the above history of the premises, in the time of
Charles the Second.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not any thing of the least importance
but what is copied from Mr. Hals.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>I have retained the whole of what is stated by Mr. Hals
respecting the proceedings at Fowey, in the periods of its
<!--049.png--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
greatest prosperity and of its subsequent fall, given partly
on the authority of Mr. Carew, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 313, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> of Lord Dunstanville’s
edition,) and in part from what he himself had
heard. It must, however, be remembered that tradition
always exaggerates facts, more especially such as bear unfavourably
either on individuals or on communities, and
that the times of Edward the Third were essentially different
from those of order, protection, and impartial administration
of justice, in which we have the happiness to live;
nor can the license or excesses imputed to some adventurers
at Fowey, be more abhorrent to our feelings than the
mean artifice of a feeble government, practised to entice
men from Fowey to Lostwithiel, under a pretence of
enabling them to assist their country in the prosecution of
a war, but really with the view of arresting them as
criminals.</p>

<p>The fact of this port having sent forty-seven ships,
with seven hundred and seventy mariners, to the siege of
Calais in 1346-7, would exceed all belief, were it not established
by national records; and Mr. Carew relates their
vanquishing, in a private feud, the naval armaments of Winchelsea
and Rye, two members of the Cinque Ports (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
315). But these two ancient towns, and the Five Ports
themselves, exhibit a contrast scarcely less remarkable than
Fowey, between their actual appearances and the relative
importance they must have once attained; except that Hastings
is enlarged for the temporary residence of strangers,
and Dover from the like cause, in addition to its being
the well-known station for packets.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that the Priory of Tywardreth exercised
considerable feudal authority over Fowey, which,
however, not only fell into disuse after the general dissolution
of monasteries, but, in all probability, was greatly
diminished by the subsequent incorporation of the town.</p>

<p>The right of voting for Members of Parliament, up to the
period when it discontinued to send any, in 1832, was
vested jointly in resident payers of scot and lot, and in
<!--050.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
copyhold tenants of the manor taken from Tywardreth by
Henry the Eighth, and annexed by him to the Duchy of
Cornwall.</p>

<p>This manor was purchased by the late Mr. Philip Rashleigh,
about the year 1800, under the powers created by
the Land Tax Redemption Act. This gentlemen and his
ancestors had long represented Fowey, and he was succeeded
by his nephew, Mr. William Rashleigh, who subsequently
sold the manor, and the whole borough property,
to Mr. George Lucy, of Charlecot, near Stratford-upon-Avon.
Mr. Lucy, in consequence, represented Fowey,
and retained what he had purchased till in 1832 it became
quite useless for all election purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Thomas Austen is the present representative
of the ancient and distinguished family of Treffry, one
of the most spirited adventurers in mines, and of the most
judicious and enlightened managers, that Cornwall has witnessed
for many years. Mr. Austen has diverted a river for
the use of machinery; and he has sat the first example of
bringing a canal to mines, for the purpose of conveying
coal and other heavy articles, from the sea-coast, and of
taking down the ores, which are then exported from a harbour
of his own construction.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives an account somewhat different from
that of Mr. Hals, respecting the final repulse of the French
from Fowey. He attributes the achievement to one of
Mr. Austen’s female ancestors; and, quoting from Leland,
adds that after this event “Thomas Treffry builded a right
fair and strong embattled tower in his house, and embattling
the walls of the house, in a manner made it a castle,
and even to this day it is the glory of the town buildings in
Fowey.” The present possessor has, however, added considerably
to the beauty of this “right fair” mansion, by
completely restoring whatever might be defective in the
existing parts, and by completing, or perhaps by improving,
the original plan.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Philip Rashleigh, who represented Fowey
<!--051.png--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
during the greater part of a long life, added to his character
of a most respectable country gentleman, the well-deserved
reputation of a skilful and zealous naturalist, more
especially in the department of minerals, to which, as a
Cornish man, his attention would be more particularly
directed. Mr. Rashleigh led the way in Cornwall as a
collector, on a large scale, of the interesting and curious
products of the mines, and left at his decease perhaps the
most valuable collection of minerals belonging to any individual
throughout England. Geology had not acquired
the semblance of a regular science when Mr. Rashleigh
directed his attention to the metallic ores, and to the chrystallography,
not of Cornwall alone, but of all parts of the
known world. He has given to the public two volumes of
coloured engravings from his choicest specimens.</p>

<p>Mr. Rashleigh attained a good old age, with the satisfaction
of witnessing the progress through life, in various
lines, of the younger branches of his family, with the highest
credit to themselves, and of leaving his ample property to a
nephew in all respects worthy of receiving it.</p>

<p>For various further details respecting Fowey, the Editor
must refer to the recent Histories of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives an ample account of the descents or
alienations of manors; and a very curious letter from Lord
Thomas Cromwell to the Prior of Trewardreth, dated on
the 21st of May, but without the insertion of any year,
probably, however, not long before the dissolution. See
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 109 of Lysons’s Magna Britannia, <abbr title="volume three">vol. iii.</abbr> Cornwall.</p>

<p>A considerable property was accumulated about the
middle of the last century by two brothers, natives of this
town, of the name of Lamb. One filled the office of Collector
of the Customs at Fowey, the other practised medicine
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell; both left their fortunes to an only sister,
who after their deaths, and late in life, married Mr. Graham,
a gentleman from London; through whom the property
has passed to his nephew, Thomas Graham, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
Sheriff of Cornwall in 1806, a magistrate for the county,

<p>This little parish is formed by a belt of high and precipitous
hills, and is principally composed of a very interesting
rock. It is of a dark colour, does not alter in the
streak, and abounds in iron pyrites; it is a kind of shale,
and in the cliff, not far from the church, contains a layer of
some carbonaceous mineral, to the intimate diffusion of
which the colour of this rock appears to be owing. The
section of the hill by the road side, from the church to
Valancey Bridge, exhibits the layers of this rock convoluted
and contorted in a most extraordinary manner; and the
same appearance is beautifully illustrated in the cliffs at the

<p>Tregeare, in this parish, was the voke lands of the Bishop
of Bodmin, now the Bishop of Exeter’s great lordship, so
called. In the Domesday Book for Cornwall, 20th William
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, it is named Tregara-an, id est, the town of
the friend, or lover, of God. Concerning the possession of
this manor, by virtue of the Bishop of Exeter’s lease, there
happened a costly and troublesome suit, both in law and
equity, between Edward Nosworthy, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> then in possession
thereof, and Hugh Trevanion, of Treligan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in the
latter end of the reign of Charles the Second, James the
Second, and part of the reign of William the Third (as I
was informed). The case being thus:</p>

<p>The tenure of those lands being copy of Court Roll, or
freehold for life, the Bishop of Exeter, the lessor, grants to
the lessee a fee-farm lease of the said manor, for three
lives absolute: and so, by custom and law, each of these
lives named in the said lease are entitled to the land successively
after each other’s death, and have power successively
in like manner to grant copies of court roll to the
under-tenants of those lands absolute for three lives, to
succeed each other. Now it happened that Trevanion
bought the remainder of one of those lives, in reversion, of
<!--056.png--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
Nosworthy or some other first life named in the Bishop’s
lease; after the death of whom, Trevanion’s right by custom
commenced; who accordingly delivered ejectments upon
the lands and tenements of the said manor, by consent
and approbation of the Bishop of Exeter for the time being,
and brought down a trial at Launceston on the same,
where the issue passed for Trevanion.</p>

<p>Thereupon Nosworthy filed his bill in chancery, prays a
writ of injunction to stop further proceedings at common
law, and to be relieved in the premises; where, after many
commissions for examination of witnesses, and hearing of the
merits of the cause in favour of Nosworthy’s title, it passed
for him. The plaintiff Trevanion thereon prays that another
issue at law might be directed out of Chancery to
try this matter; which accordingly being granted, upon
the issue it again passed for the plaintiff, and afterwards, as
before, upon all hearings in Chancery it passed against
him, by the universal opinion and judgment of the Lord
Chancellors and Lord Keepers for the time being: “That
it was contrary to equity and good conscience that any
person, who was only named a life on the bishop’s lease, to
the farmer of the manor, or the lives named on the farmer’s
lease, or copy of court roll, to under-tenants, without ever
paying a farthing consideration of money, should sell or
carry away the original lessee’s estate, who pays a valuable
consideration for it, or from his heirs or assigns after his
death.” So that, in fine, Nosworthy’s title was confirmed
by a decree in Chancery. But, as I said before, the cost
of this controversy pro and con lasted so long, and proved
so chargeable, as was very conducing to the ruin of both
those gentlemen’s estates, (vide Cargoll in Newland,)
Nosworthy absconding into Holland, and Trevanion procuring
himself to be made one of the Poor Knights of
Windsor.</p>

<p>It was the happiness of Cornwall, in the latter end of the
reign of Charles the Second, to behold Mr. Justice Dolben,
appointed for two or three Assizes one of the Judges Itinerant
<!--057.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
for this county, who so discouraged the injustice, delay,
and frivolousness of many Cornish law-suits, and so uprightly
and succinctly, upon proof of matters of fact and
law, directed the jury as to their verdict, that there was
little or no occasion for the wrangling and jangling arguments
of counsel at the bar. He further told the people
in general, that he admired how they should be so weak in
judgment, as to be persuaded into so many lawsuits in this
province, wherein was nothing but pride, heat, mistakes, or
malice, by the advice and direction of lawyers and attornies,
whose trade and occupation was only to get money,
without regard had to the merit or success of their causes
longer than their client could dispense with cash. Upon
those and the like arguments of this upright and conscientious
judge, the number of our Cornish trials was much
abated, and fell from a hundred and sixty <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venire facias</i>
brought to about seventy; so that it was generally hoped
by this means we should have had as few lawsuits depending
in this as in other countries, or that all controversies
would be ended by references amongst ourselves, and that
it would be said of the Court of Common Pleas by commission
transmitted to Launceston, as was said of the Court
of Chancery when Sir Thomas More was Lord Chancellor
thereof, tempore Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, who by his upright judgment,
and discouragement of trivial Chancery suits, had
ended all causes depending therein, so that the clerks and
counsel had no more business there to do; whereupon one
made this rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">When More some time had Chancellor been,</div>
  <div class="i2">No more suits did remain:</div>
  <div class="i0">The like will never more be seen,</div>
  <div class="i2">Till More comes back again.</div>
</div>

<p>But, alas! this good Judge Dolben soon after, by the
attornies and lawyers of the Western Circuit all in confederacy
together, as the shrine-makers of Diana at Ephesus
against <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, prompted a petition to Charles the Second
against him, suggesting that the overhasty proceedings of
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
this judge, and his discouraging lawsuits, tended not only
to the damage of his Majesty’s revenues proceeding from
lawsuits in those parts, but to their great prejudice, hurt,
and damage, in point of their support and livelihood, as
having little else besides their profession and practice of
law to subsist by; which petition Charles the Second taking
into further consideration, against the next assizes he ordered
the clerk to leave Judge Dolben’s name out of the
commission of oyer and terminer, and then he was never
more seen in those parts. Since which time the judges
that come this circuit are content to hear with great patience
the loud, reflective, perplexed arguments of counsel
upon trials of small moment and concern, if not to suffer
themselves to be at some times imposed upon in point of
law and evidence therein, by the importunate arguments of
topping serjeants-at-law, according to the magnitude of the
fees they receive from their clients; so that it is become a
proverb among those men in this province, it matters not
what the case be so the client hath store of money.</p>

<p>Tre-ligan, or Tre-ligon, in this parish, (i. e. the legate,

Caryhaye’s family. He married Crossman, the relict of
Courtney of Penkivell, and had issue by her &mdash;&mdash; Trevanion,

<p>Most of the lands in this parish, if not the whole, are
either part of the manor of Tregear, or are held from it.
This hath been, ever since the first erection of the see, in
the Bishop of Cornwall, and in the united bishopric seated
at Exeter. It has for many ages been held by different
gentlemen under the Bishops, on leases for lives.</p>

<p>The family of Nosworthy held it for some time; the
last of which family, Edward Nosworthy, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> assigned it,
a few years before his death, to Henry Vincent, of Trelevan,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> but Mr. Nosworthy, who was the last life, dying
suddenly at Dunkirk in 1701, it fell into the Bishop’s hands,
then Sir Jonathan Trelawny, who granted a new lease of
it in trust for his own family, with whom it now resteth. But
the barton was separated from the manor and granted
apart, as it was in the time when Nosworthy held the manor,
to the Trevanions of Trelegar, between whom and the
Nosworthys arose a great lawsuit, as is related by Mr.
Hals.</p>

<p>Near to this barton is Trewithian, that is, the town of
peace. In this village Mr. Edward Cregoe hath lately built
a good house. He married Sarah, the daughter of John
Foot, of Treleyassick, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> and is lately dead, leaving a
young widow and three sons, of which the eldest is christened
Friend.</p>

<p>To the south of this is Trelegar, the downy town. This
is likewise a large village, at one end of which stood the
seat of a younger branch of the Trevanions of Carhays.
Hugh Trevanion, who was engaged in the expensive lawsuit
with Mr. Nosworthy, had a son, Hugh Trevanion.
This gentleman was so reduced as to become Governor of
the Poor Knights of Windsor. The father sold Trelegar,
in the latter end of Charles the Second’s reign, to Stephen
Johns, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p><!--060.png--><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
Between Trelegar and Trewithian is a double round
Danish intrenchment, which being very high, the middle
serves for a beacon, by which name of Beacon it is called.</p>

<p>To the westward of Trewithian is Tregalravean, that is
the small miry dwelling; and such it really is. This place
has recently been leased by copy of court roll from the
manor of Tregear, to Edward Hobbs, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr></p>

<p>Roseteage. This is rightly interpreted by Mr. Hals,
the fair or beautiful valley; and its delightful situation doth
fairly entitle it to this appellation.</p>

<p>This place, in the reign of Elizabeth, and of James the
First, was the seat of Reginald Mohun, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a younger
brother to Sir William Mohun, of Hall, and a captain under
Sir Walter Raleigh. This gentleman never marrying,
sold the barton (which is held from the manor of East
Greenwich, in Kent, by the payment of three peppercorns
yearly when demanded,) with the royalty of wreek, and
in November 1619, the 19th year of James the First, to
Nicholas Kempe, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who was the younger brother of
Humphrey Kempe, of Lavethan, in Blisland, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who is
the chief of that name in Cornwall.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Since the splendour of the Bishop’s residence has disappeared,
if it ever existed, Roseteague has been, without all
comparison, the leading place in this parish, and indeed
few more beautiful situations can any where be found. It
continued in the family of Mr. Kempe from the year 1619
till about 1780, when Roseteague was purchased by Mr.
Harris, of Rosewarne, in Camborne, aad given by him to
Mr. Richard Harris, one of his younger sons; but this
gentleman having remained single, the estate has reverted
to the only daughter and heiress of the eldest son, William
Harris, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall in 1773, married to
Henry Winchcombe Hartley, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Berkshire.</p>

<p><!--061.png--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
Trewince, situated on a hill northward of Roseteague,
and separated from it by a deep valley, is also a place well
deserving of notice. An extremely good house was built
here about the year 1750, by the grandson or great-grandson
of the gentleman who made the purchase of Trelegar
from Mr. Trevanion, and it is now inhabited by his grandson.</p>

<p>The church commands an extensive prospect from an
elevated piece of ground, and contains a splendid monument
to the family of Hobbs; and near the church still
exists a public bowling-green. Bowling appears to have
been the favourite amusement of gentlemen residing in the
county up to a later period than the middle of the last
century. A weekly meeting used to be here numerously
attended during the summer, but as most landed proprietors
then occupied a portion of their own estates, it was an
invariable rule to discontinue their pastime when the appearance
of a single Arrish Mow, indicated the more important
avocations connected with harvest.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has noticed that a Bishop of Exeter endowed
this church, the one half as a rectory, the other as a vicarage.
This division was effected in a very unusual manner,
although in one not quite without example. Instead
of apportioning the tithe of corn to the rector, and all other
portions, as small tithes, to the vicar, the whole has here
been divided into equal shares; so that Mr. Johns, of
Trewince, the lay impropriator, is entitled to one-twentieth
of every thing titheable, and the incumbent to another
twentieth.</p>

<p>On the coast eastward of the church town is a village
called Polskatho, or Porthskatho, the boat-harbour; and
here an extensive fishery is carried on, more especially for
mackarel. This place, with the manors of Pettigrew and
Nanquitty, belongs to J. S. Enys, of Enys, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and they
have been long possessed by this very ancient and respectable
family.</p>

<p>The barton of Tregeare was purchased in 1712 of the
Hoblyns of Bradridge, by Samuel Kempe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Carclew.
<!--062.png--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
In 1765 it was leased by Frederick Bishop of Exeter,
on lives, to Nicholas Kempe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Rosteague, of whom
it was purchased in 1767 by his cousin Nicholas Kempe,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Chelsea, and it remained in 1823 in the possession
of John Kempe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Newington, Surrey. The
Kempes sold Rosteague to John Harris, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in 1780.</p>

<p>Trewithian is now vested in Matthew Garland Cregoe,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who married Anna Coryton Kempe, eldest daughter
of the late Arthur Kempe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Admiral of the White.</p>

<p>The Kempes of Cornwall were derived from the knightly
family of Kempe, of Olantigh, in Wye, in Kent; Richard
Kempe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> grandson of Sir William Kempe, Sheriff of
Kent 20 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> is the first of the family recorded to

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The rocks of this parish belong to the same series as
those of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony in Powder. On the eastern side of
Porthskatho Cove the blue slate is very much curved and
contorted; and is intersected by innumerable quartz veins,
which are exceedingly irregular, and partake much of the
same arrangement as the laminæ of the slate. Here also
occur, interstratified with the slate, beds of a compact blue
rock, which is very hard, and effervesces with acids, occasioned
by particles, and minute veins or strings, of calcareous
spar. In the cliff also may be seen a small patch of
conglomerates, and red sandstone of the most recent formation,
such as is common on these shores.</p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Rex Athelstanus in potestatem Anglorum dedit unum

monastery of monks, and for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s canonical brothers
and servants in Cornwall. He also enriched with
jewels, money, or lands, every considerable abbey in this
land. Baker’s <abbr title="Chronology page">Chron. p.</abbr> 10.</p>

<p>This Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s was afterwards endowed
with larger revenues by King Canute, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1020, who
turned it, after ninety years continuance in monkery, to a
collegiate church of secular canons, which might marry
wives, converse in the world, as not tied to a monastic life,
first introduced by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Berinus, Bishop of Dorchester, anno
<abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 635; that is to say, a society or corporation of religious
men, under the government of a dean, warden, provost,
and master, to whom belonged clerks, chaplains, singing
men, or choristers. Of those men, the gloss upon the
Canons Clementine tells us, that secular priests have no
certain order or fashion of apparel appointed them, forasmuch
as there is no express mention made in any canon,
neither of the colour or form thereof, by which two differences
the other several orders of religious men and women
are distinguished or discerned.</p>

<p>In this Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 986, Bishop
Stidio placed the see or seat of his Cathedral Church, (for
Bodman was before burnt by the Danes,) which he and his
successors enjoyed till the year 1032, at which time Livignus,
first a monk of Winchester, afterwards Abbat of Tavistock,
then made Bishop of Kirton, by King Canutus,
who after the death of Berwoldus, the thirteenth Bishop of
Cornwall, prevailed with that King to annex the bishopric
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, thus translated there, to his bishopric of
Kirton, and turned this college of secular priests into a
priory of Black Canons Augustine, from whence afterwards
Leofrick, chaplain to King Edward the Confessor, 1049,
by licence, consent, and approbation of that King, removed
both those bishoprics to Exeter. And this fact of Kirton
is more manifest from the missal or mass book of the said
Leofrick, given to the church of Exeter.</p>

<p>This Monastery or Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, founded by
King Athelstan, was as aforesaid by King Canute turned
into a collegiate church of secular canons, over which a
prior was governor or ruler, who, after he had endowed the
same with lands and revenues, King Ethelred the Second
having before given Bishop Stidio, to recompense his loss
by the Danes, the great lordship of Cunan Boake, still pertaining
to the Bishop of Exeter (see Prince’s Worthies of
Devon, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 9) he ordained many good laws which sound
thus in English:</p>

<p>“We will and command that God’s Ministers, the Bishops,
Abbats, Priors, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> do in especial manner take a
right course and live according to rule, that they call to
Christ night and day much and oft, and that they do it earnestly:
and we further command that they hearken to God,
and love chastity; full truly they wit that it is against the
right to meddle with women.” Canute’s Laws, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 6.</p>

<p>The word abbat is derived from the Hebrew abba, pater,
for that he is the father or governor of his monks, who together
make up a spiritual society or corporation. Some
abbats were elective by the convent, others presentative,
and under this title also was comprehended other corporations
spiritual, as a prior and his convent, friars, canons, and
such like; and as there were lord abbats so there were lord
priors, who had exempt jurisdiction, and were lords of parliament,
and what consecration is to a bishop, the same is
benediction to an abbot or prior, but in different respects,
for a bishop is not such before consecrated, but an abbat or
<!--066.png--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
prior, being elected or confirmed, is properly such before benediction.</p>

<p>Some abbats were mitred from the pope, and so exempt
from the bishop’s jurisdiction, as having granted them from
him episcopal authority; and if either abbats or priors
were called by the King’s writ as barons to parliament,
they were called abbats and priors sovereign; see statute
9th Richard <abbr title="Two chapter">II. chap.</abbr> 4. But, alas! neither this Abbat of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, nor the Prior of Bodmin, nor any other in
this province, was either a baron of Parliament or a mitred
man, but were all subject to the visitation and spiritual
government of the Bishop of Exeter, till <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
when all those orders of religious men were dissolved.</p>

<p>In this abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1040, in the
time of Lurginus Bishop of Kirton, lived Hucarius, commonly
called the Levite, as Bale and Pits, in their writings
of Britain, tell us; either for that he assisted the priest
at the altar as the Levites of old did, and was more excellent,
or did excel all others in that particular; otherwise,
by the appellation Levite we must understand him a priest,
and that he was universally famous in performing his function
of preaching and divine service. Certain it is, he was a
holy and learned man, (according to the laws of King Canutus
aforesaid,) as the 110 homilies or sermons, and many
other books which he wrote, declare; but whether he was
a native of this province or not, I know not.</p>

<p>This Priory of Canons Augustine was dissolved 26th
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> and its revenues valued per annum 243<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> according
to Speed and Dugdale’s Monasticon Anglicanum.</p>

<p>This borough town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, as Mr. Carew saith,
mustereth many inhabitants, and sundry ruins, but little
wealth; occasioned either by abandoning their fishing-trade,
as some conceive, or their being abandoned of their
religious people, as others imagine. It appears to have
been the voke lands of a manor before the Norman Conquest;
since it is rated in Domesday Roll, 20th William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>

<!--067.png--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
before that time it was a monastery or abbey of monks,)
and consists of a Portreeve and forty Censors; and the
Portreeve yearly chosen, in the manor court, by the major
part of the Censors. And the Members of Parliament are
in like manner elected by the major part of them, and the
precept from the Sheriff for their election, (as also to remove
any action at law depending in this to a superior
court,) must be thus directed: “Præposito et Seneschallo
Burgi nostri de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germanᵒ, in Comitatu Cornub. salutem,”
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Note, that in old British, reve, reeve, is rent,
tithes, or revenues. Port-reeve is the bearer or gatherer
of the gate or borough rent.</p>

<p>The arms of this priory are only the letters G. P.</p>

<p>It is further privileged with a weekly market on Friday,
and a fair yearly, August 1.</p>

<p><span class="title">The history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German.</span> He was a native of Gaul,
about the year of our Lord 380, born of wealthy, rich, and
Christian parents, by whom he was bred up and baptized
into the Christian religion. After which he followed the
study of the liberal arts and sciences, and so profited therein
that he was generally noted for a very learned man.
But that which made him most famous was his piety and
virtue; wherein he so far excelled most other men of his
time, that he could not be at rest, or have peace in himself,
till he made known his propensions to a religious course of
life. Whereupon he was admitted into deacon’s orders,
then into priest’s, and lastly advanced to the dignity of
Bishop of Antiscidorum, or Auxerre, in France, anno
<abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 425.</p>

<p>After he took upon him the office of a bishop, he discharged
the same with great justice and piety, admitting
none into orders within his jurisdiction, but such as were
men of great learning and sound faith, but especially such
as were neither Arians nor Pelagians. For about that
time the Christian church was grievously pestered with
two heretics; the one Arius, born and bred at Constantinople;
the other an inhabitant of Britain, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Pelagius.</p>

<p><!--068.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
But the doctrines of Pelagius manifesting themselves
throughout this land, to the great disturbance of the orthodox
faith and churches thereof, after great heats and animosities
between Catholics and heretics about those doctrines,
it was at last agreed upon between those parties that
a General Council of the Clergy in Britain should be convened
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, in Hertfordshire, and those tenets
further examined and discussed. But the British Catholics,
knowing the interest, skill, and subtlety of the heretics to
be great, thought it not safe for religion, and the orthodox
faith, in this convention to trust alone to their own skill
and learning, therefore concluded on this expedient, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
against the day of meeting to send for some foreign divines
for their coadjutors or helpers in this controversy; and accordingly
applied to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German, Bishop of Antiscidorum
aforesaid, or Auxerre, in Gallia, now France, a city situate
upon the river Auxona, now called Le Disne, and Lupus,
Bishop of Troyes, in that country, for their counsel and
assistance, who gladly granted their request; and accordingly
against the day, and at the place appointed, met the
British Clergy on both sides; where the tenets and doctrines
being heard, and particularly examined, chiefly by
the skill and learning of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German, were all refuted and
condemned, according to the sense of the General Councils,
as impious and heretical, to the great satisfaction of the
orthodox clergy.</p>

<p>After this dispute and council ended, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German, as a
good bishop, resolved, though out of his country and diocese,
whilst he stayed here, to preach the Gospel publicly,
and to that end caused a pulpit to be set up in an open
place at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, (so called from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban, the Briton,
martyred there under Dioclesian, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 303,) anciently
Verulam; where on set days he preached to the
multitude there assembled, and first began to handle the
doctrine of Pelagius against original sin, taking for his text
the words of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Evangelist: “If we say that we
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
have no sin we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.” Upon which subject he shewed that the doctrine of
Pelagius was contrary to the writings and doctrines of
Moses and the Prophets.</p>

<p>These and the like words and preachings of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German
seemed so angelical and full of power to the Britons, that
generally they were convinced of Pelagius’s errors, and
abandoned their former opinions; and in testimony of their
unfeigned respect and remembrance of him, in the very
place where he preached at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, they erected a chapel,
and dedicated it to the honour of God, in the name of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German; which chapel was extant (and still bears his
name) tempore James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> though misapplied to profane
uses. (See Camden, in Hertfordshire.) After <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German
had thus preached down Pelagianism at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, he
travelled through Britain, Wales, and Scotland, on the same
account, as our chronologers tell us; and that, in the place
where Oxford stands, he preached six months against the
heresies aforesaid. That he was in Cornwall upon the
same account I doubt not, since there is still extant in this
parish whereof I treat, a large church bearing his name.
He was in Wales, for Camden, in Flintshire, informs us a field
bearing his name, called Mars Garman, i. e. German’s field,
in memory of a battle there obtained by the Welch over the
Picts, on the prayers of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German, and by crying Hallelujah!
To him also is ascribed the building or augmenting
Landaff cathedral there, and dedicating it to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Delyan,
if there be not a mistake in the chronology thereof, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
German, as appears to me, being dead before Delyan.</p>

<p>That he preached in Scotland, is evident from his meeting
and converse with Patrick, born at Bluisdale, in that
country, who became his disciple, and afterwards the
apostle of Ireland.</p>

<p>This priory-house, before its dissolution, was called
Porth-Prior, or Port-Prior, synonymous words, signifying
either the prior’s creek, cove, or haven. It is now, after
the name of its owner, transnominated to Port or Porth-Eliot,
<!--070.png--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
who derives his title thereto from Champernowne, as
he did by a boon from King Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>These gentlemen I take to be of Scots original, and so
denominated from the local place of Eliot, near Dundee, in
Scotland, and their descent of later time from the Eliots of
Devonshire, Berkshire, or Cambridgeshire, of which last
county one Sir Thomas Eliot, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> was Sheriff 24th
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> also in 36th. This gentleman wrote a book
called Defensorium bonarum Mulierum, The Defence of
good or virtuous Women. But that which made him most
famous was, (to the disgrace of the critics and clergy that
get their livings by the liberal arts and sciences, he being
only a layman,) he wrote and composed the first Latin and
English Dictionary that ever was seen in England, about
the year 1540. Upon whose stock and foundation Bishop
Cooper and others built and grafted all the Latin and
English dictionaries now extant in Britain. He died in
Suffolk, 1546; and upon the foundation, rules, and observation
of this my Parochial History of Cornwall, it will be
very easy for any other person to make a better and more
perfect History thereof.</p>

<p>Those gentlemen settled here about the middle of Queen
Elizabeth’s reign, and there ever since flourished in this place
in genteel and worshipful degree, serving their king and
country in the several capacities of Justices of the Peace and
Members of Parliament for their Borough of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s;
and amongst them, in particular, it were great injustice to
forget the memory of that worthy patriot Sir John Eliot,
<abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> for his bold asserting the prerogative and privilege of
Parliament, the freedom and liberty of the subject, in the
House of Commons, against the arbitrary and despotic
power of the British Monarch, then exerted and setting up
by the Attorney-general Noye and others, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
as before it had been done by Cecil Earl of Salisbury <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>: for which reasons and arguments of law he was
committed prisoner to the Tower of London by order of
that King, where he died, without payment of the 2,000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
<!--071.png--><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
fine laid upon him, but not without suspicion of poison,
about the year 1638.</p>

<p>Edward Eliot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> is now in possession of this estate.
He married the daughter of Craggs.</p>

<p>Bake, in this parish, is the dwelling of the ancient and
gentle family of the Moyles; so called, I presume, from
the local place of Moyle, in or about <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Minvor, who have
flourished here for several generations in worshipful degree,
ever since they married with the sole inheretrix of this
name and place; originally descended, as I am informed,
from the Moyles of Tresurans, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, or the
Moyles of Bodmin. The present possessor, Sir Walter
Moyle, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> son of John Moyle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall
22 James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> that married Morrice, giveth for his arms,
in allusion to their name, Gules, a moyle (or mule) passant
Argent.</p>

<p>I take Thomas Moile, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Speaker of Parliament 34th
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> 1543, ancestor of the Moyles of Oxford and
Kent, whose name, blood, and estate is terminated in the
Finches, to be a younger brother of this family, or those
of his.</p>

<p>Colt-dryn-ike, in this parish, i. e. dry neck lake, leate,
or riveret of waters, (perhaps so called from some lake or
leate that intermits its current in summer season,) is the
dwelling of Jonathan Trelawney, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> one of his Majesty’s
Commissioners of the Peace, a younger branch of the Trelawneys
of Poole and Trelawne houses, and therefore giveth
the same arms which they do. Since the writing hereof
this gentleman is dead without issue; and his second
brother, my very kind friend, Major John Trelawney, Fort
Major of the royal citadel of Plymouth, succeeded to his
estate.</p>

<p>Millin-ike, alias Melin-ike, i. e. the mill lake, leate, or
bosom of waters, (so called from some river and a mill
heretofore thereon,) was the dwelling of William Scawen,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that died without issue.</p>

<p>The name Scawen is local, and signifies a place where
<!--072.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
skawan or elder trees grow, (as I have said before,) and is
derived from the Japhetical Greek, σκοβιεμ, sambachus,
ebulus, the elder-tree, who, suitable to his name, gives for
his arms, Argent, a scawen or elder-tree Vert. This is an
ancient and mere British family of gentlemen, as their
name implies.</p>

<p>Hendre, in this parish, (i. e. the old or ancient town,)
is the dwelling of the gentle family of the Hancocks; particularly
William Hancock, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Catch-French, in this parish, was the seat of the Keckwitches,
originally descended from the Keckwitches of
Essex, gentlemen heretofore also of considerable estates in
those parts, now by ill conduct wasted, so that this barton
was sold by John Keckwitch, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> to
Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who settled it upon his daughter
Bridget, married to Hugh Fortescue, of Filley, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> now
in possession thereof. George Keckwitch, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of this
house, was Sheriff of Cornwall 17th of Elizabeth, as was
also his son George Keckwitch, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> <abbr title="thirty-third">33d</abbr> of Elizabeth.
He was also a Commissioner of the Peace <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
who gave for his arms, Argent, two lions on a bend Sable,
coticed Or.</p>

<p>The town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s lieth to the southward of Port
Eliot, but adjoining with it, and between that and Cuddenbeck:
but as Browne Willis, in his Notitia Parliamentaria,
has given a particular description of this town and parish,
of which he was the most capable, having married his lady
out of it, I shall here insert what he has said thereof:</p>

<p>“Its first return of Members to serve in Parliament, was
in the session held by proclamation in the 5th year of
Queen Elizabeth, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1562, at which time their having
Representatives was questioned; however, Mr. Speaker
declared in the House that the Lord Steward agreed that
they (i. e. the two Members) should resort there with all
<!--073.png--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
convenient speed to show their letters patent, whereby they
be returned. In this indenture the returning officer is
called the Mayor, but in the next, and in all other records,
the Portreeve; which magistrate is yearly nominated and
chosen at the lord’s court-leet, held about Michaelmas by
his steward, who impannels a jury for that purpose. As to
the choice of Members of Parliament, all the inhabitant
householders have votes, that have lived a year within the
borough, the bounds of which do not extend very far, and
only comprehend about fifty or sixty houses lying near the
church, and not the whole vill of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, great part
of which is without the borough, as is the rest of the
parish. It is styled in some writings Cuddenbeck Borough;
a privilege which it might perhaps have obtained
from Walter Bishop of Exeter, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> when
Penryn seems to have been made a borough; and from this
example the Prior, with the assistance of the Bishop, might
also have dignified in like manner the vill of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s,
though neither of them, anno 30th <abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr> when they certified
respecting their liberties, and claims of privilege, as of
markets, fairs, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> styled this place otherwise than the manor
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s; nor have I met with it under any
other denomination than till Queen Elizabeth’s time, or
seen any record mentioning its incorporation, nor any other
charter of privileges granted thereunto; though the inhabitants
have a tradition that they had an ancient charter,
which was unfortunately stolen from them by a person imprisoned
by the Portreeve, who is by prescription bailiff of
the town, and may make what house he pleases within the
borough, his prison. As to a description of this borough,
called by Carew ‘a church town,’ it mustereth, as that author
tells us, sundry ruins, but little wealth.”</p>

<p>Browne Willis gives the following account of the Priory:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“After the removal of the bishoprics from Crediton
and from this place to Exeter, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1050, Leofric, the
first Bishop of Exeter, changed the seculars of this collegiate
church, founded by King Athelstan, and endowed by
<!--074.png--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
King Canute, into Black Canons, between whom, and his
new-erected episcopal see, the manor of this town was
divided; and it stood upon that establishment at the time
of the Norman invasion, as appears from Domesday Book,
which informs us, that the manor or parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s
consisted of twenty-four hides, whereof the Bishop of Exeter
had twelve, and the Canons of that place twelve also.
What belonged to the Bishop was valued at 81<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per annum,
and what belonged to the Canons at 100<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> Domesday
also shews us, that in this manor there was then a market
on the Lord’s Day; but it became reduced to nothing,
by reason of that of the Earl of Morton’s being very near,
which I conceive might have been kept at Trematon, that
Earl having privilege of a market at his castle there. That
such was the state of this town and parish at the time of
the Conquest, is plain from the above-stated record; and
the division into two manors continues to the present day,
the Bishop’s moiety being held by lease for three lives by
Edward Eliot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> proprietor of the other manor; whose
predecessors have probably ever since the dissolution of the
monasteries been farmers, or lessee tenants, to the See of Exeter,
by virtue of which lease, as this manor is vested in them,
so the other, belonging to the Priory, has thus descended since
the surrender thereof, dated March the <abbr title="second">2d.</abbr>, anno 30th
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when Robert Swimmer, the last Prior, with
seven Monks, yielded up the same into the King’s hands,
who not long after, by letters patent dated March the 10th,
anno regni 33, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1542, granted to John Champernoun,
John Ridgeway, and Walter Smith. Among other lands,
the site, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> of this priory, upon partition, came to John
Champernoun’s share, whose heir sold it, about thirty or
forty years afterwards, to Richard Eliot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> my wife’s
ancestor, in which family both those manors yet continue:
which place, soon after Mr. Eliot had made the purchase,
was named Port Eliot, since when this appellation has so
far prevailed that Port Eliot has been inserted in maps, as
if it was a particular vill. This family flourished for eight
<!--075.png--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
or ten generations in Devonshire, before their transplanting
themselves hither, and had matched into several considerable
families in that county, as the Sigdons, Cotlands, Bonvilles,
Sumasters, Fitzes, Careswells, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Walter Eliot
was returned among the gentlemen of Devonshire anno
1433, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> And to this family, as it should
seem by the arms, was allied Sir Richard Eliot, made by
King Henry the Eighth one of the Justices of the King’s
Bench, who was, as I take it, father to the famous Sir Thomas
Eliot. Richard Eliot seated himself here, where he
lived (as Carew tells us) in great hospitality. He left issue
John Eliot, born and baptized here April 20, 1592. This
John, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1607, became a gentleman commoner of Exeter
College, Oxford, which place leaving about two or
three years after, he went to the Inns of Court, and May
the 10th, 1618, received the honour of knighthood, and
was all his lifetime after a member of the succeeding Parliaments,
in one of which, <abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> he was chosen
knight of the shire for Cornwall. He was a very plausible
speaker in the House of Commons, as his speeches published
testify, but, being a virulent enemy to the Court,
often suffered confinement, and died in custody in the
Tower of London; and, as appears by the inquisition on
the 27th of November, 8th Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1632, leaving
issue John, his son and heir, then twenty years old. This
John was born at Port Eliot, and baptized October 18th,
1612, where he died and was buried March the 25th, 1685,
leaving an only son, Daniel Eliot, my father-in-law, who
departed this life about the sixtieth year of his age, and
was buried among his ancestors October 28th, 1702. This
gentleman, in regard that he had only one daughter, named
Katherine, bequeathed his estate, in order to keep up the
name of his family, to Edward Eliot, grandson to Nicholas
Eliot, fourth son to Sir John Eliot, Knight, aforesaid.”</p>

<p>Mr. Browne Willis then goes on to state respecting the
remains of the monastery.</p>

<p>“The Priory fronts the river, now called, as above
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
noted, Port Eliot. It is a handsome large building, containing
several spacious rooms, and has a court before it,
adorned with a strong pier by the present proprietor,
Edward Eliot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who has much beautified the whole
building.” Since Mr. Willis wrote the above, almost the
whole of the ancient building has been taken down, so that
except the refectory, now called the gallery, very little
remains.</p>

<p>In the 26th year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth,
this place had an honour bestowed on it (little taken notice
of, if not altogether forgotten), by being established by Act
of Parliament the see of a suffragan bishop for the county
of Cornwall, in the diocese of Exeter.</p>

<p>The advowson of this church, together with the impropriate
rectory, late the possessions of the priory, valued at
61<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> per annum, were granted by King Edward
the Sixth to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor, in
whose hands they now continue.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germanus is among the most celebrated saints of
the fourth and fifth centuries, having gained his reputation
by furiously opposing the unpopular doctrines of Pelagius;
at the same time that he adopted all the brutalizing austerities,
which in those days conveyed power, influence, and
reputation to all who practised them.</p>

<p>Pelagius maintained that Almighty God has been pleased
to bestow on mankind, from their births, power and inclination
to execute his will, and to render themselves acceptable
in his sight; while the orthodox supported, on the
contrary, a doctrine more analogous to the practices of
earthly despots and tyrants, by declaring that such powers
were capriciously given, by little and little and from time
to time, branding their opponents with an accusation, well
suited to the understanding of those from whom distinction
could then be obtained, namely, that Pelagius set up man
<!--077.png--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
as independent and in opposition to God; forgetting or
concealing that the free gift was and must have been the
same in both cases, differing only in the manner after which
it is bestowed. Perhaps the arbitrary disposition of fiefs, commencing
about that period, afforded an additional analogy
for assimilating the practices in heaven to those on earth,
while appeals to the capricious exercise of arbitrary power
afforded evidently the most ample field for vehement declamation.
The saint is stated in his legend to have sprung
from an illustrious family, and, while the appellation implied
a real office, to have been made Duke of a Roman
province, and in that capacity to have been leader of the
troops, with whom he obtained repeated victories, and acquired
the just reputation of an able warrior. He also
excelled in the chace, but neither his skill in military stratagems
nor in the devices of the field, could protect him
against falling into an ambuscade laid by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Amator, Bishop
of Auxerre, who, having learnt from a dream, that the
young Duke should succeed to the bishopric, enticed him
into the church, and then, securing the doors and passages,
imposed on him the tonsure, with the order of a deacon.
Germanus appears to have submitted with perfect resignation
to this important change in the whole tenor of his life,
and adopting the line afterwards pursued by Sir Thomas of
Canterbury in regard to spiritual matters, and that in respect
to his wife, which enrolled King Edward the Confessor
in the list of saints, he soon obtained a reputation so high
as to point him out as the most proper person, first to succeed
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Amator, as Bishop of Auxerre, in fulfilment of the
dream, and then to go on a spiritual crusade against the Pelagians
of Britain. He accordingly embarked, accompanied
by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lupus, in the midst of winter, and soon encountered
a violent storm, raised, it would seem, on purpose to
evince the divine mission of these two saints, for, on their
throwing some holy water into the sea, it immediately subsided.</p>

<p>Saint Germanus and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lupus not only preached with
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
such power as to astonish and to convince whole congregations,
too large for any building to contain, but they gave
sight to the blind, cast out devils, and raised the dead. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Germanus was even induced to assist the faithful in the way
of his original profession; for a Pagan army of Northmen
and Picts invading the Christian provinces, the saint took
the command of such persons as he found willing to defend
their country, and having selected a place suited to his purpose,
either by naturally possessing an echo, or by receiving
it miraculously from his prayers, he there awaited the
enemy, and on their approach shouting three times <span class="sc">Alleluiah</span>,
and the whole army joining with their utmost might,
the divine sounds, repeated and enforced by the reverberation
on all sides, so terrified the assailants as to drive them
into immediate flight, with the casting away of their arms,
who were, in consequence, readily and safely pursued
with great slaughter, through the whole space separating
them from their fleet, none being spared but such as had
the grace instantly to acquiesce in a method of conversion
so clear, so powerful, and so coercive.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germanus and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lupus soon afterwards left Britain,
in the full confidence of having suppressed the heresy;
but so obstinate and perverse were the people, that it broke
out with increased violence, the circumstance of Pelagius
being their countryman having probably more weight with
the inhabitants than the arguments on either side, as in
modern times all German Protestants are followers of Luther,
as those of France are invariably of Calvin.</p>

<p>On receiving this intelligence, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germanus made a
second voyage to Britain, armed with a small box of relics,
suspended round his neck by a leathern string, which acting
in aid of his own inherent sanctity, produced a train of
miracles more wonderful even than those of the first expedition.
Success of course attended him; and when the
work of conversion was complete, he deposited the box of
relics in the shrine of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban, to be preserved for future
use, if the seeds of heresy should again vegetate, taking in
<!--079.png--><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
exchange some ashes of the British protomartyr. He
then finally left Britain, returning to his diocese of Auxerre,
on the confines of Burgundy; but on the way he encountered
a second Pagan army, employed by the Christian
Emperor of Rome to ravage the saint’s province, in revenge
for some popular insurrection. The saint succeeded,
however, in converting the general, with all his forces, and
then proceeded to Ravenna, in Italy, to obtain a pardon
for the offenders. In this he was also successful; but having
now filled the measure of his earthly services, and, as
was usual in such cases, having predicted the hour of his
own dissolution, he expired at Ravenna, in the odour of
sanctity, on the last day of July, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 448. His remains
were brought back to France, with all the honours due to
the successful leader of any party, spiritual or temporal,
and they were finely enshrined in the oratory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Morice,
which he had founded at Auxerre, and where an
abbey has since been built. Various places in Britain
were dedicated to him as to their tutelar saint. Of these the
abbey of Selby was on the largest scale, and the priory in
Cornwall distinguished by his own name, held the next
place; although a chapel near the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban,
where he had triumphed in a general disputation with
the heretics, became most celebrated, multitudes flocking

<p>The ancient Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s has again assumed a
new form since the time of Mr. Tonkin, in consequence of
Mr. Richard Eliot having greatly increased his fortune by
marrying Harriet, daughter of James Craggs, Secretary of
State in the time of King George the First. This gentleman,
and still more his son, Mr. Edward Craggs Eliot, who
obtained an hereditary seat in Parliament, after representing
Cornwall in the House of Commons, added so much to
the place, by enlarging the house, by embanking against the
sea, and by laying out the grounds, as to make it one of the
first among gentlemen’s seats in the West of England. The
<!--080.png--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
statute referred to by Mr. Tonkin, for conferring the honour
of a suffragan see on this town, in the 26th Henry
<abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> c. 14, passed in the year 1534, by which it is declared
that Thetford, Ipswich, Colchester, Dover, Guilford,
Southampton, Taunton, Shaftesbury, Molton, Marlborough,
Bedford, Leicester, Gloucester, Shrewsbury,
Bristow, Penrith, Bridgewater, Nottingham, Grantham,
Hull, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Pereth, Berwick, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germain’s,
and the Isle of Wight, shall be taken and accepted
for sees of Bishops Suffragans, to be made in this Realm.
This statute appears to have been very little if at all acted
on; but two of the towns, Gloucester and Bristol, as is
well known, became the seats of independent bishoprics.</p>

<p>At Bake lived Mr. Walter Moyle, of whom Cornwall
has reason to be proud. He represented Saltash in the
reign of King William; but, notwithstanding several successful
efforts in the House of Commons, Mr. Moyle retired
to his family seat, and past the remainder of his time
in learned leisure, where he died in 1721, not having completed
his fiftieth year. Most of his works were published
separately, but in 1727 came out in London, “Works of
W. Moyle that were published by himself; with some account
of his life and writings, by Anthony Hammond, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
<abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr>” His works were principally:</p>

<p>An Argument, showing that a Standing Army is inconsistent
with a free Government.</p>

<p>Translations from Xenophon.</p>

<p>The Miracle of the Thundering Legion explained.</p>

<p>A Charge to the Grand Jury at a Sessions in Liskeard.</p>

<p>Letters to Dr. W. Musgrave, of Exeter, on subjects of
Criticism and Antiquity.</p>

<p>A Dissertation upon the Age of Philopatris, a Dialogue
commonly attributed to Lucian.</p>

<p>Letters to and from Mr. Moyle on various subjects.</p>

<p>Remarks on Prideaux’s Connection of the Old and New
Testament.</p>

<p>Bake now belongs to Sir Joseph Copley, whose grandfather,
a brother’s son of Mr. Walter Moyle, having married
the heiress of Copley, of Sprotborough, in Yorkshire,
assumed her name.</p>

<p>Aldwinnick is the property of Mr. Charles Trelawny,
son of Mr. Edward Trelawny, who acquired it under the
will of Mr. Charles Trelawny, who died in 1764, the last
male descendant of their branch of the family. Mr. Edward
Trelawny’s original name was Stephens.</p>

<p>Catchfrench was till lately the residence of Mr. Francis
Glanville, Member some time for Plymouth. This gentleman’s
ancestors purchased Catchfrench from the Fortescues
more than a century ago. Mr. Glanville has given it
up to his son, and on quitting the county he has carried
with him the regret of every one in it.</p>

<p>Much obloquy having been cast upon Sir John Eliot, by
a misrepresentation on the part of his political adversaries,
of an affair in which sudden passion very probably caused
him to act in a manner different from what would have been
his conduct under other circumstances, I will add a narrative
of the occurrence, taken from Lord Nugent’s Life of
Hampden.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In a letter in the possession of Miss Aikin, written by
an ancestor of one of the most respectable families in Devonshire,
the cause and course of the quarrel are given, as
described by the daughter of Mr. Moyle himself, a witness
not likely to be unjustly partial to Sir John Eliot.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Mr. Moyle having acquainted Sir John Eliot’s father
with some extravagancies in his son’s expenses, and this
being reported with some aggravating circumstances,
young Eliot went hastily to Mr. Moyle’s house, and remonstrated.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“What words passed she knew not; but Eliot drew his
sword, and wounded Mr. Moyle in his side. On reflection,”
continues Mr. Moyle’s daughter, “he soon
<!--082.png--><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
detested the fact, and from thenceforward became as remarkable
for his private deportment, in every view of it,
as his public conduct. Mr. Moyle was so intirely reconciled
to him, that no person in his time held him in higher
esteem.”</p>

<p>The editor cannot induce himself to believe that an
English gentleman, a patriot, and ultimately a martyr in
the cause of national freedom, could have formed and endeavoured
to execute a plan for deliberate assassination;
he is, moreover, unwilling perhaps to believe it of one
who married the heiress of his own paternal family. It
would be unfair, however, not to state that Mr. D’Israeli,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
one of the most intelligent and candid of modern writers,
and of the highest authority, has found in the course of his
miscellaneous researches, various documents placing this
transaction in a point of view much less favourable to Sir
John Eliot, than would be inferred from Lord Nugent’s
account of it. The editor, however, continues to hope that
these documents are coloured, at least, by the party spirit
of times immediately preceding civil war, when all occurrences,
private as well as public, receive their tincture
from contending factions.</p>

<p>This extensive parish is entirely situated within the calcareous
series. On the northern part it touches the serpentine
of Clicker Tor; and from thence to the sea-shore
it exhibits many repetitions of clay slate, of calcareous schist,
and of black limestone. An extensive quarry of the latter
rock, near Trerule Foot, shews the nature of this limestone.
It is of a dark-blue colour, compact, and rather hard; and
in some parts of the mass it is very glittering, in consequence
of the numerous shining facets of calcareous spar
disseminated throughout. This rock abounds also in veins
of calcareous spar, and the whole may be traced passing
gradually into the adjacent calcareous schist.</p>

<p>In this tract beds of compact, and of schistose hornblende
rocks, are also found, such as are common in this series of
rocks at Saltash, at Padstow, Veryon, and at various other
places.</p>

<p>In this parish stands Godolphin-Ball. This is that inexhaustible
mountain, or tin-work, which for some hundreds
of years hath afforded its owners or lord, the Lamburns,
Stephens, Navas, now Godolphins, and other adventurers,
several thousand pounds worth of tin.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>In this parish stands Godolphin, or Godolphin-Ball,
from whence the lands thereof were denominated de Godolphin;
who for many ages have had a considerable augmentation
of their paternal estate by the casualties of tin
from thence issuing. The same is a barren mountain, of
pretty large extent and great height; and, although
wrought for tin at the least during three hundred years,
seems still, like the widow’s cruise of oil and barrel of meal,
to increase in the using, for, notwithstanding the incredible
quantities of tin that have been taken thence in former
ages, it still affords employment, and pays the wages, with
<!--085.png--><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
some overplus, of at least three hundred men throughout
the year.</p>

<p>The name of this parish is derived from its patron <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Germow, or Germach, said to be an Irish king, who came
over with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breage. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germow is there buried, and
his tomb or chair is still to be seen in the churchyard.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has given the history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gordian at very
great length, to whom, without the slighest authority, he
assumes this church and parish to have been dedicated. I
have omitted the whole, as entirely unconnected with Cornwall,
and because the very existence of such a saint is at
the least doubtful. The writers of legends now content
themselves with stating that some one of that name was
beheaded at Rome in the year 362, as appears from the
ancient Martyrologies; that his body lay many centuries in
a cave, together with the remains of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Epimachus, brought
there from Alexandria, and that both relics are preserved
in the Benedictine Abbey of Kempton, in the diocese of
Ansbury.</p>

<p>The tradition of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germoe having been a king in his
native country, is cherished by the inhabitants up to the
present time, and they point to his tomb or shrine in the
churchyard, with an evident feeling of their being elevated
by his dignity.</p>

<p>But, on whatever grounds the ancient claims of this
parish may rest to a canonized or to a royal patron, the
village of Bojil has in modern times bestowed more real
honour on the whole district, than could be derived from
regal missionaries or from legendary saints.</p>

<p>In the parish register of Breage may be seen the following
entry: “William, the son of William Lemon, of
Germo, was baptized the 15th day of November, 1696.”</p>

<p>I have endeavoured, but without much success, to collect
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
information respecting this very extraordinary man. It
appears that his father and mother, whose maiden name
was Rodda, were in a situation of life raised above the
common level, and that they bestowed on their son the best
education easily attainable, who on his part became eminently
distinguished among his companions. If young
Lemon ever, therefore, employed himself in executing
the inferior labours usually performed by mining boys, as
some have alleged with the view of increasing the wonder
of his subsequent progress, and others impelled by less
laudable motives, it is clear that they must have been undertaken
from a desire of making himself practically acquainted
with all the details of perhaps the most delicate operations
in metallurgy.</p>

<p>His bodily strength and firmness of mind seem to have
been commensurate with those abilities, which displayed
themselves most conspicuously in after life. Within my
recollection, the people of Breage and Germoe were fond
of relating that Squire Lemon in his youth made the foremost
link of a living chain, which, connected only by the
grasp of their hands, extended itself into a tremendous surf,
and rescued various human beings from a watery grave.</p>

<p>At a very early age, Mr. Lemon became one of the managers
of a tin-smelting house at Chiandower, near Penzance;
and the career which he pursued with so much
ability and success, was traced for him at this place.</p>

<p>The ancient mining of Cornwall, like that of Banka in
the present day, had been confined for a long succession of
ages to merely collecting diluvial deposits of tin ore, which,
from its great specific gravity, is always found beneath
every other debrit, and immediately incumbent on the solid
rock, or unmoved strata, provincially called “the Fast.”
As the first operation invariably consists in washing away
the lighter ingredients, by agitating the whole in streams,
which never fail of gliding through the vallies where alone
these deposits are found, the name “stream-work” has
<!--087.png--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
been adopted, to distinguish these sources of tin from
mines which descend on the lodes themselves.</p>

<p>Mines invariably grew out of the stream-works, but with
a progress so very slow as scarcely to be imagined by persons
conversant only with the rapid improvements of modern
times. Pits were at first sunk on the backs of lodes,
till the presence of water impeded the work. Shallow adits,
or drains, were obviously used in favourable situations, and
the windlass, with its bucket and rope, must be of great
antiquity. To this succeeded the rack and chain pump,
identical with those still used in large ships; but the span
beam and cage, moving on a perpendicular axis, by which
the labour of horses became applicable to what had previously
been done by the human arm, are so very modern,
that the Editor remembers a carpenter who used to boast
that he assisted in making the first whim ever seen westward
Hayle.</p>

<p>A new era had, however, now commenced. The steam-engine,
which consists essentially in a piston alternately
sliding through a cylindrical vessel, invented by Mr. Newcomen,
of Dartmouth, had been used at least on one mine,
called the Great Work, in Breage, when Mr. Lemon came
forward, gifted with the ability and the energy which enabled
him to anticipate, by nearly half a century, everything
that could add to the wealth and to the prosperity of his
native county.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemon first associating himself with Mr. George
Blewett, of Marasion, and with Mr. Dewen, commenced
working a mine on a farm called Trowel, in the parish of
Luddvan, the property of Lord Godolphin, and named
Whele Fortune, where the second steam-engine was used.
Capital was of course requisite for the undertaking, and
that is said to have been supplied to Mr. Lemon by his
marriage. It appears, from the register of Gulval, that
“William Lemon and Isabel Vibert were married April
the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr>, 1724.” The Viberts were among what are termed
the good <a name="livers" id="livers"></a>lines in Gulval parish, and Mrs. Lemon had recently
<!--088.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
succeeded by will to the property of Mrs. Elizabeth
Noles her godmother, and probably relation, who had
acquired a fortune by some business at Chiandower.</p>

<p>But fortune, except perhaps for its timely supply of
capital, was the least of Mrs. Lemon’s recommendations;
uniform report has represented her as entirely worthy of
the very extraordinary person to whom she was united.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemon is said to have gained from Whele Fortune
ten thousand pounds; and, thus enabled to execute more
extensive plans, he removed to Truro, and commenced
working the great Gwennap mines, on a scale never witnessed
before, and perhaps never contemplated, in Cornwall.
<a name="Carnon" id="Carnon"></a>Cavnon Adit was either actually commenced, or
at the least was effectually prosecuted, by Mr. Lemon; a
work unrivalled for extent or for utility in the mines of
England, and his exertions increasing as his means enlarged,
Mr. Lemon soon became the principal merchant
and tin-smelter of Cornwall. But the energies of his mind
were not limited to these undertakings, great as they were;
he cultivated a taste for literature, and, what is extremely
unusual, acquired, amidst business, and at a middle age,
the power of reading the Classic authors in their original
language. In the year 1742, we find his name in the list
of Sheriffs. He became one of the magistrates of Truro,
and might have represented the borough in Parliament.
He obtained from Government a drawback of the duty on
coal used in mines, when Sir Robert Walpole, then at the
head of public affairs, complimented him on the clear and
able manner in which he had made every statement; and a
present of silver plate from Frederick Prince of Wales, as
Duke of Cornwall, is preserved in his family.</p>

<p>About the same time he was mainly distinguished as
“the great Mr. Lemon;” but, above all, so strongly were
the impressions received of his abilities, his exertions, and
general merit, that a progress so rapid and unexampled does
not appear to have excited envy, or any of those bad
passions which usually alloy the enjoyments of prosperity.</p>

<p><!--089.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
Mr. and Mrs. Lemon had but one son, and no daughters.
Mr. William Lemon, <abbr title="Junior">Jun.</abbr> married Ann, only
daughter of Mr. John Willyams, of <a name="Carnanton" id="Carnanton"></a>Cannerton, near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Colomb, and sister of the late Mr. John Oliver Willyams,
many years Colonel of the Cornwall Militia. He died at an early period of life, and several years before his father,
who lived to the 25th of March 1760, and is buried in
Truro church, where he had built by far the largest and
most decorated house in the town. He had also purchased
and improved Carclew, since become the family seat.</p>

<p>The younger Mr. William Lemon left two sons and a
daughter. The elder of the sons, Sir William, represented
the County of Cornwall in Parliament during fifty years, and
commanded the regiment of militia. The second son,
John, became a Colonel in the Guards, represented Truro,
and commanded the Miners’ Militia. The daughter married
Mr. John Buller, of Morval, near Looe.</p>

<p>As instances of the respect paid to the commanding
genius of Mr. Lemon, the people of Truro are said to have
drawn back from their doors or windows as he passed
through the street. And the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Walker, a respectable
although a fanatical clergyman, exhorting the
children to be circumspect in the presence of Almighty God,
incautiously added, “Only think, my dear children, how
careful you would be if Mr. Lemon were looking upon you.”</p>

<p>There was a <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Genesius, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Genes, of Auvergne in
France; he exterminated heresies and founded monasteries.
His festival is kept on the third of June, and he is said to
have died in the year 662. Such were the heroes of those
days, and therefore he may possibly have been selected as
patron of this church.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons states that Treveeg, formerly a seat of the

<!--091.png--><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>

<p>The Yeos were persons of consequence in the north of

<p>Mr. Lysons further states that the manor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gennis
was for some time the property of Treise, from whom it
passed by marriage to Morshead. It must since have
been sold in the general wreck of that family.</p>

<p>Lord Rolle has also a manor in this parish. And another
manor, called Treworgy, (a name common in Cornwall,
and meaning a house or village on a stream,) belonged
to the Priory of Canons of the Order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine,

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The whole of this parish is situated on the massive and
schistose varieties of Dunstone, which are so prevalent in
the northern parts of Cornwall and Devon. The Dunstone
is in general very silicious, and it thus constitutes
high and barren hills. A very curious variety of this rock
occurs at Tresparret Down. It is in a state of decomposition,
but when it is broken numerous hard rounded nodules
fall out, having uniformly small crystals of pyrites in their
centres. The same rock, in an unaltered state, forms the
cliff on the left side of Crackington Cave, near the church,
where it is inclined at an angle of 40°, having the entire
surface covered with projecting nodules, which give it a
blistered appearance not unlike that of hæmatites.</p>

At the time of the Norman Conquest this district was

Winchester, 1294, in this province, the church is not
named, probably it was not then extant, or not endowed;
neither is it mentioned in Wolsey’s Inquisition 1521, or

<p>Pen-coit, alias Pen-coid, alias Pen-quite, all synonymous
words, signifying head or chief wood, or head of the wood,
is a name given and taken from the once natural circumstances
of the place, from whence was denominated an ancient
family of gentlemen, surnamed de Pencoit. And
here lived John de Pencoit, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
who held one acre of land in Lamellyn of 5<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> price, (that
is to say a Cornish acre, consisting of 60 statute acres) for
making and keeping the king’s grey coat when he came
into Cornwall, due out of Cabulion, from Peter, the son of
Orger. [Carew’s <abbr title="Survey of Cornwall">Sur. Corn.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 45. See also Pengelly in

<p>This barton is now the dwelling of John Barret, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
Sheriff of Cornwall 3 William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> whose ancestor is said
to have come out of Normandy with William the Conqueror,
1066, an ensign under Colonel Henry de Ferrers, commonly
called Henry Earl Ferrars, son of Wakelyn; to
whom the Conqueror gave the castles of Tutbury in Staffordshire,
and Oncomb in Rutlandshire. Since which
time this gentle family of Barrets have flourished in this
county in good fame and reputation for above twenty descents.
The present possessor of Pencoit married Kendall
of Medroff, and giveth for his arms, Gules, a bend Varry.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>How these names of Glant or Golant prevailed over that
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sampson I am not able to determine, unless perhaps
it was the primitive name thereof before the parish church
was erected, consecrated, and endowed to God under the
name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sampson. For in Cardinal Wolsey’s Inquisition,
and in Carew’s Survey, it is called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sampson.</p>

<p>The name Golant is obviously compounded of Gol, holy,
and of lan, a church. (Mr. Whitaker remarks that Y-Gol,
by the Holy One, is still an oath in Cornwall.)</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has given a very long and uninteresting account
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sampson, the patron saint of Golant, involving
a dissertation on the antiquity of archbishops.</p>

<p>He is reported to have commenced his ecclesiastical career
by the practice of ascetic observances, in due time he
became the chief of a monastic institution, from whence he
was taken to be Archbishop of York; but the north of
England being at that time ravaged by the northern
pirates, he was driven from thence, and going over into
Brittany he founded a monastery at Dal, and became the
first Bishop of that place, where a see was created at his
request by Pope Pelegius the First, who honoured him
moreover personally with the pallium or <a name="err2" id="err2"></a>pale. He was
present at the Second Council of Paris, held in 557, and
died about the year 564. His remains were enshrined at
Dal, but when the Normans began in the tenth century to
invade and pillage Neustria, these barbarians, equally hostile
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
to the saint alive or dead, obliged his brethren to remove
the relics to Paris, where they are supposed to have
been preserved up to the period of the great revolution.</p>

<p>Penquite was acquired by purchase about the beginning
or towards the middle of last century from the Prestwoods,
by Mr. Rashleigh, of Menwhilly, by whom a perpetual
lease was soon after granted in favour of a relation, which
has since passed through various hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says that the manor of Lentyon in this
parish, belonged to the Montacutes Earls of Salisbury.</p>

<p>It appears from Dugdale’s Baronage that this property
was seized by king Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, on his judicial murder of
the last Plantagenet, Margaret Countess of Salisbury. It
now belongs to Mr. William Rashleigh, who is impropriator
of the great and small tithes, and appoints the perpetual
curate, in right of the monastery of Tywardreth.</p>

<p>A castle is said to have belonged to this manor, but no
traces of it remain; the appellation seems indeed to have
been very loosely applied in the latter part of our feudal
times, so as frequently to indicate no more than the residence
of a chief.</p>

<p>The village round the church, or, according to the expression
used in Cornwall, “the church town,” is always
called Golant. The houses are situated in a romantic cross
valley, nearly where it terminates in Fowey River.</p>

<p>The inhabitants boast that in this village was established
the first boarding-school for young ladies that appeared in
Cornwall, and they call the attention of visitors to these
peculiarities connected with this church:&mdash;“That it has a
fire-place within it; that a well of water flows over in the
porch; and that a tree in the churchyard o’ertops the
tower.”</p>

<p>This parish measures 1340 statute acres.</p>

Carverth (i. e. rock-strength, or car-veth, rock-grave), who
being bred to sea affairs and navigation in his youth, was
taken into the service of King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> in the beginning
of his Dutch and French war, 1665, to whom he gave the
command of a frigate, in the several engagements of the
Dukes of York and Albemarle in their sea-fights with
those nations; wherein he demeaned himself so well in
point of valour and conduct, that after those wars were
ended he was chosen one of the standing Captains under the
Earl of Ossory, for which he received about 300<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum
salary, during his life, which ended about the year 1684,
when he had a military interment in this church: who
dying without legitimate issue, left his brother, Thomas
Carveth, of this place, gentleman, his heir and executor,
who giveth for his arms, Argent, a chevron between three
talbots Sable. Those gentlemen, from living at Carveth,
or Carverth, in Mabe, were transnominated from Thoms
to Carverth; as another family of those Thomses, from
living at Carnsew, in the said parish, were transnominated
to Carnsew; and there are some deeds yet extant dated

<p>Between the parishes of Budock and Gluvias, on a promontory
of land shooting into the sea creek of Falmouth
harbour, between two vales and hills, where the tide daily
makes its flux and reflux, stands the ancient borough of
Penrin, or Penryn, a name given and taken from the
natural circumstances of the place; and by the name of
Penrin it was taxed as the voke lands of a considerable
manor in Domesday Roll, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087. (See <span class="sc">Brin</span>,
<span class="sc">Bryn</span>, in <span class="sc">Withell</span>.)</p>

<p>This place I take to be the Οκρινυμ (Ocrinum) of Ptolemy.
The town was a privileged manor, with a court
leet, before the Norman Conquest; and in the year 1230
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
King Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> granted a charter to William Brewer,
Bishop of Exeter, then lord thereof, as his successors still
are, in right of the bishopric of Bodman, or Cornwall, long
before annexed to Exeter. (See more in <span class="sc">Lanwhitton</span>.)
It was also incorporated by King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> by another
charter, consisting of a Mayor, Recorder, and Portreeve,
eleven Magistrates, and twelve Assistants; with liberty to
send two of its members to sit in the Commons’ House of
Parliament, to be elected by the majority of those that are
freemen, and pay rates and taxes. It is also, amongst
many other things, appurtenanced with markets weekly,
upon Wednesdays and Saturdays; fairs on May 1, July 7,
December 21; and of old had free warren in all the King’s
lands. The arms of this town are a Saracen’s head couped
at the shoulder, and crowned, or environed, with a laurel.</p>

<p>The precept from the Sheriff on the Parliament writ,
as also to remove an action at law depending in this leet
to a superior court, must be thus directed: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Majori et
Burgensibus Burgi sui de Penrin in Comitatu Cornubiæ
salutem,”</span> otherwise, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Proposito, Ballivis, et Burgensibus
Burgi sui de Penryn;”</span> and to remove an action from the
court leet of Penryn foreign: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Senescallo et Ballivis
manerij de Penrin forreigne salutem.”</span></p>

<p>But, alas! notwithstanding all its privileges, our Cornish
historian, Mr. Carew, in his time, tells us that on the top
of a creek Penrin town hath taken up its seat; rather
passable than notable for wealth, buildings, or inhabitants.
Though now, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempore</i> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> I take it to be much
altered for the better in these particulars, and to be parallel
with, or equal therein, with any other town in Cornwall.
And, moreover, I look upon it as the most commodious,
pleasantly situated, and healthful borough within that province,
it being situated upon a hill, and having continually
passing through its streets a useful river of water, and
through the gardens and orchards of the town, behind the
street-houses on each side, pass two considerable mill-leats,
or rivers of water, met daily by the flux and reflux of the sea.</p>

<p><!--100.png--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
Where, on the south of this town, on one of those rivers,
Walter Brounscomb, Bishop of Exeter, 1260, at a place
called Glasnith, or green-ford, so named from the estuaries,
or ebbing and flowing of the sea under it, founded and
endowed a collegiate church of Black Canons, or Canons
Augustine, that could not marry wives, consisting of twelve
prebends and a dean; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Clerici tresdecem, personæ discretæ,”</span>
are the very words of the leger book of its foundation;
and then endowed and confirmed all by a charter
in these words, as translated from Bishop Brounscomb’s original
Latin.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“To give to God, the blessed Virgin Mary, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Thomas of Canterbury, in Budock, Penryn, and Glasnith
College, and his thirteen canonical brothers and their
successors, all lands, woods, meadows, waters, pastures,
mills, laws, rents, and courts, and all things to the same
pertaining, to possess, have, hold, and enjoy for ever. This
agrees with the register,</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="sc">Robert Michell</span>, Register, 1611.”</p>

<p>Afterwards this collegiate church, thus founded and endowed,
and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Thomas
Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, received a greater
augmentation of wealth, lands, and revenues from John
Grandison, Bishop of Exeter, 1358, who had persuaded all
rich priests of his diocese to make him his heir and executor,
in order to build and endow churches with their
riches; which trust, in a great measure, he performed to
his lasting credit and renown; so that at length, amongst
others, this collegiate church’s yearly revenues, at the suppression,
26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> was valued at 205<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 10<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 6<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>
according to Speed and Dugdale’s Monasticon Anglicanum,
now worth 1200<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span></p>

<p>This collegiate church is now entirely demolished. Since
the beginning of this century there was one of its towers
standing, but it is lately pulled down, and a dwelling-house
built in the place where it stood.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>After transcribing, with little variation, what has been
stated from Mr. Hals, Mr. Tonkins adds,</p>

<p>Enis, in this parish, gave name to an old family of
gentlemen from thence, denominated de Enis; that is to
say, of this island; for innis, ennis, enys, signify in Cornish,
an island, and also a tongue of land where two rivers
meet.</p>

<p>John Enys, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> acquired a great flow of wealth by his
marriage with Ann, only daughter of Mr. Henry Greys
of Truro. His son, Samuel Enys, is the present possessor
of the estate; he married Dorothy, daughter of Thomas
Willis, of London, merchant, and has lately succeeded to a
considerable fortune by the decease of her two brothers, Sir
Thomas and Sir William Willis, of Fen Ditton, in Cambridgeshire,
Baronets, the last in the year 1733. This

all the other branches in estates, and have served their
country as Members of Parliament, Commissioners of the
Peace, Sheriffs, and Deputy-Lieutenants. The arms of
Pendarves are, <abbr title="Sable">Sab.</abbr> a falcon rising <abbr title="Argent">Arg.</abbr> between three
mullets, Or. I cannot refrain from making some remarks
on Alexander Pendarves, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> the last of this family.</p>

<p>He was Surveyor-general of the Crown and Duchy
lands in Cornwall to Queen Anne, and a Member of
Parliament the greatest part of his life. He married Mary,
eldest daughter of the Honourable Bernard Grenville,
brother of Lord Lansdowne, a beautiful young lady, but
she did not bring him any children. He died in 1726,
very suddenly, at his house in London, being then a
burgess for the town of Launceston. His death was a great
surprise to all his friends, and especially to me, with whom
I had taken a hearty breakfast that very morning at my
aunt Vincent’s, at Chelsea. I must add, that on the Sunday
before he and I bore up the pall to John Goodall, of
Fowey, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> buried in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret’s, Westminster; and
that on the Sunday fortnight after, I had the misfortune to
bear up his in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s, Savoy. He was the last male
of the family of Pendarves in this place, which, with the rest
of his property, has devolved to his niece, Mary, the only
daughter and heiress of his brother, John Pendarves,
clerk, Rector of Drews Teignton, in Devonshire, and relict
of Francis Basset, of Tehidy, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; and this lady is now
the possessor, paying an annuity of £.400 a-year to her
uncle’s widow. But before I leave this place I must not
forget to give this just character of my deceased friend,
with whom I had the honour to serve as burgess for
Helston, in Queen Anne’s last Parliament; that for good
humour, good sense, for a true and sincere adherence to
the interests of his country, and for a harmless merry disposition,
<!--103.png--><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
he hath left not many his equals, and none that
exceed him, in this county.</p>

<p>This parish takes its name from the saint to whom the
church is dedicated.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals gives a very improbable etymology for the
name of this parish, deriving it from the Cornish verb,
<dfn>glewas</dfn>, to hear, which he quotes from the 12th stanza of
Mount Calvary.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">
  <div class="i0">An ger a Du maga del wrei neb vynno tro glewas.</div>
  <div class="i0">Lavar &emsp; Du maga del wrei neb a vynno y glewas.</div>
  <div class="i0">The word (of) God feed so will do (he) who is willing to hear,</div>
</div>

<p>The first line is transcribed from Mr. Hals, the second
is the line as it stands in the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> from which the editor
of this work has printed Mount Calvary.</p>

<p>The Editor has not been able to find any traces of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Gluvias, but these may have easily disappeared amidst the
throng of our provincial hierarchy.</p>

<p>The borough of Penryn, with enlarged limits, has been
united with Falmouth in sending two Members to Parliament
under the constitution of 1832. Of the principal
inhabitants noticed by Mr. Hals, the Hearles had risen
into most importance. They were the younger branch of
a family said to have migrated into Cornwall, and to have
settled at Prideaux, in Luxulian, and afterwards at
Trelawn, in Pelynt, usually written Trelawny, since it
was purchased by a gentleman of that name. The last
Mr. Hearle, of Penryn, married the heiress of Paynter,
of Trelisick, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth; and having lost an only son, his
daughters became coheiresses, who married Mr. Rodd, of
Trebartha, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Henry Hawkins Tremayne, and
Captain Wallis of the R. N.</p>

<p>Enys is now the property of John Samuel Enys, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
where his family are ascertained, by authentic documents,
to have been seated from times far back in the reign of
<!--104.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
the Plantagenets, and probably from periods antecedent
to them. Samuel Enys represented Penryn in the first
Parliament of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and they appear in every page
of our list of Sheriffs. Mr. Enys has built an excellent
new house on the foundation of the old; and very recently
(1834) he has married Catherine Gilbert, the Editor’s
eldest daughter.</p>

<p>The manor of Cosawis, or Gosose, was a part of the
large possessions taken from the Bodrugons by Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
and given by him to Sir Richard Edgecumbe, whose descendant,
Lord Mount Edgecumbe, parted with it to the
late Sir William Lemon.</p>

<p>But a farm called Bohelland has for two centuries continued
to excite great curiosity and attention on account
of its having been the place where events occurred in real
life more horrible than the most heated and gloomy imagination
could well invent. Mr. Lysons refers to a small
pamphlet of eight leaves, printed in black letter, and accompanied
with several wood-cuts, entitled, “News from
Perin, in Cornwall, of a most bloody and unexampled
Murder, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>” but not having given any clue for finding
it, the Editor has examined several public libraries without
success. The following narrative has, however, been extracted
from a work entitled “The Reign and Death of
King James, of Great Britain:”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He had been blessed with ample possessions and fruitful
issue, unhappy only in a younger son, who taking liberty
from his father’s bounty, and with a crew of like condition,
that wearied on land, they went roving to sea, and in a
small vessel southward, took boot from all they could master,
and so increasing force and wealth, ventured on a
Turk’s man in the Streights; but by mischance their own
powder fired themselves, and our gallant, trusting to his skilful
swimming, got on shore upon Rhodes, with the best of his
jewels about him; where offering some to sale to a Jew, who
knew them to be the Governor’s of Algier, he was apprehended,
and, as a pirate, sentenced to the gallies among
other Christians, whose miserable slavery made them all
<!--105.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
studious of freedom, and with wit and valour took opportunity
and means to murther some officers, got on board of
an English ship, and came safe to London; where his
misery, and some skill, made him servant to a surgeon,
and sudden preferment to the East Indies. There, by this
means he got money; with which returning back, he designed
himself for his native county, Cornwall. And in a
small ship from London, sailing to the west, was cast away
upon that coast. But his excellent skill in swimming, and
former fate to boot, brought him safe to shore; where,
since his fifteen years’ absence, his father’s former fortunes
much decayed, now retired him not far off to a country
habitation, in debt and danger.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“His sister he finds married to a mercer, a meaner match
than her birth promised. To her, at first, he appears a
poor stranger, but in private reveals himself, and withall
what jewels and gold he had concealed in a bow-case about
him; and concluded that the next day he intended to
appear to his parents, and to keep his disguise till she and
her husband should meet, and make their common joy
complete.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Being come to his parents, his humble behaviour, suitable
to his suit of clothes, melted the old couple to so
much compassion as to give him covering from the cold
season under their outward roof, and by degrees his travelling
tales, told with passion to the aged people, made
him their guest so long by the kitchen fire, that the husband
took leave and went to bed. And soon after his true
stories working compassion in the weaker vessel, she wept,
and so did he; but compassionate of her tears, he comforted
her with a piece of gold, which gave assurance that
he deserved a lodging, to which she brought him; and
being in bed, shewed her his girdled wealth, which he said
was sufficient to relieve her husband’s wants, and to spare
for himself, and being very weary fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The wife, tempted with the golden bait of what she
had, and eager of enjoying all, awakened her husband with
<!--106.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
this news, and her contrivance what to do; and though
with horrid apprehension he oft refused, yet her puling
fondness (Eve’s enchantments) moved him to consent, and
rise to be master of all, and both of them to murder the
man, which instantly they did; covering the corpse under
the clothes till opportunity to convey it out of the way.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The early morning hastens the sister to her father’s
house, where she, with signs of joy, enquires for a sailor
that should lodge there the last night; the parents slightly
denied to have seen any such, until she told them that he
was her brother, her lost brother; by that assured scar
upon his arm, cut with a sword in his youth she knew him;
and were all resolved this morning to meet there and be
merry.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The father hastily runs up, finds the mark, and with
horrid regret of this monstrous murther of his own son,
with the same knife cuts his own throat.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The wife went up to consult with him, where in a most
strange manner beholding them both in blood, wild and
aghast, with the instrument at hand, readily rips herself up,
and perishes on the same spot.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The daughter, doubting the delay of their absence,
searches for them all, whom she found out too soon; with
the sad sight of this scene, and being overcome with horror
and amaze of this deluge of destruction, she sank down
and died; the fatal end of that family.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The truth of which was frequently known, and flew to
court in this guise; but the imprinted relation conceals
their names, in favour to some neighbour of repute and
kin to that family. The same sense makes me therein
silent also.”</p>

<p>These dreadful events have been wrought into a drama
by Lillo, the author of George Barnwell; and if terror and
pity form the essential bases of tragedy, the “Fatal Curiosity”
is built on a most ample foundation; the sister, of course,
changes her character to heighten the effect, but in other
<!--107.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
respects the play scarcely differs from the actual course of
events.</p>

<p>The celebrated Mr. Harris of Salisbury, has given the
following account of this drama in his last work, entitled,
“Philological Inquiries.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A long lost son, returning home unexpectedly, finds his
parents alive, but perishing with indigence.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The young man, whom from his long absence his parents
never expected, discovers himself to an amiable friend, his
long-loved Charlotte, and with her concerts the manner
how to discover himself to his parents.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“It is agreed that he should go to their house, and there
remain unknown till Charlotte should arrive and make the
happy discovery.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He goes thither accordingly, and having by a letter of
Charlotte’s been admitted, converses, though unknown,
both with father and mother, and beholds their misery with
filial affection; complains, at length, he was fatigued
(which, in fact, he really was), and begs he may be admitted
for a while to repose. Retiring he delivers a casket
to his mother, and tells her it is a deposit she must guard
till he awake.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<span class="sc">Curiosity</span> tempts her to open the casket, when she is
dazzled with the splendour of innumerable jewels. Objects
so alluring suggest bad ideas; and poverty soon gives to
those ideas a sanction. Black as they are, she communicates
them to her husband; who, at first reluctant, is at
length persuaded, and for the sake of the jewels stabs the
stranger while he sleeps.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The fatal murder is perpetrating, or at least but barely
perpetrated, when Charlotte arrives, full of joy, to inform
them that the stranger within their walls was their long-lost
son.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“What a discovery? What a revolution? How irresistibly
are the tragic passions of terror and pity excited?”</p>

<p>It is no small praise to this affecting fable that it so much
resembles the Œdipus Tyrannus of Sophocles. In both
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
tragedies, that which apparently leads to joy, leads in its
completion to misery; both tragedies concur in the horror of
their discoveries, and both in those great outlines of a
truly tragic revolution, where (according to the nervous
sentiment of Lillo himself) we see</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; the two extremes of life,</div>
  <div class="i0">The highest happiness and deepest woe,</div>
  <div class="i0">With all the sharp and bitter aggravations</div>
  <div class="i0">Of such a vast transition.</div>
</div>

<p>It is a very curious circumstance that the name of these
wretched people, having been kept back at first from compassion
towards their relatives, it is now actually unknown.</p>

<p>This parish has been peculiarly fortunate in its succession
of clergymen. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Penrose, who died in 1776,
after being thirty-five years Vicar, has left the reputation of
learning, of piety, and of all the virtues which adorn
a clergyman. Mr. Temple bore a very high reputation
as a man of letters; Mr. Howell was universally esteemed;
and the present vicar, Mr. Sheepshanks, ranked in the
first lists of science and of literature at Cambridge, and
became a distinguished tutor in a college, which continues
to support the rank bestowed upon it by the greatest of
philosophers.</p>

<p>The town, lying on the back of a sharp ridge of land
dividing two deep vallies, has great beauty of situation, and
deserves in other respects the praises bestowed by Mr.
Tonkin. To travellers, however, all the circumstances
are quite different; the main street descending with the
ridge is scarcely safe for carriages; and the great road from
London through Truro to Falmouth, passing directly across
the ridge, has to go up and then down through streets so
steep and narrow, and in parts so turned, as to make the
safe-passage of the mail-coach a matter of wonder; these
defects have been, however, completely remedied by a road
carried round the point and accommodated with a drawbridge;
thus reducing the road to a level, and preserving the
communication by water; this improvement was made about
the year 1830.</p>

<p>This parish measures 2,271 statute acres.

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The western side of this parish skirts along the boundary
of the granite of Mabe; but it does not extend on this
rock, with the exception of a small triangular space near
Chywoon, at its northern corner. The rest of the parish
lies on felspar rocks, both slaty and massive; some of which
contain hornblende, whence it passes into green stone.</p>

<p>These felspar rocks, when they are disintegrated, afford
a soil which is covered with luxuriant vegetation, forming
a striking contrast with the utter barrenness of the adjacent
granite.</p>

<p>Goran-hoane, in this parish, signifies Goran-haven, bay,
winding of the sea, or harbour. A place much frequented
by ships, boats, barges, and lighters, for fishing and
carrying and re-carrying fish, goods, and merchandizes;
and wherein is a convenient quay, or landing-place, for
that purpose, made secure by a considerable promontory of
land that shoots far out into the sea on the west side
thereof, commonly called (for what reason I have not
learned) the Dead-man; which forms a large bay, or
winding bosom of the sea, on the east, betwixt it and Ram
Head, twenty miles distant; and such another west, to the
Lizard Point, at a like distance, all notable and well-known
places, and sea-marks to such mariners as navigate
the British Channel in those parts. In this haven town is
still extant the ruins of an ancient free chapel, wherein
God was duly worshipped in former ages by the inhabitants

<p>The barton of Bo-drig-ham, or Bod-rig-an, also Botrigan
(for in British <em>d</em> and <em>t</em> are indifferently used and pronounced
for each other) gave name and origin to an old family of
gentlemen surnamed de Bodrigham, or Bodrigan, also
<!--111.png--><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
Botrigan, who flourished here in great fame, wealth, and
reputation for several descents; and in particular here
lived Otho de Bodrigan, tem<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 17th Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> of whom
we read in Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 51: <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “Otto
de Bodrugan peregrinatus est ad San. Jacobum licentia
Domini Regis;” i. e. Otho de Bodrigan, by license of our
Lord the King, is gone a pilgrimage to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James; that is
to say, to the apostle <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Church, at Compostella,
in Spain; who had for his fellow-traveller Radolphus de
Belloprato, “qui peregrinatus est cum Ottone de Bodrigan,
cum licentia Regis, pro se et duobus valectis;” that is to
say, Ralph of the fair meadow, who by license of the King
for himself and two servants, or young gentlemen, is gone
a pilgrimage with Otho of Bodrigan. And of those it
follows, in the same page, “isti prænominati habent 40
libras terræ et redditus per ann.;” that is to say, held by the
tenure of knight’s service.</p>

<p>This Otho de Bodrigan, Sheriff of Cornwall, <abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> Richard
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1400, gave for his arms (as appears
yet on the door of this house), Argent, three bends or
bendlets Gules. And as a further testimony thereof, Nicholas
Upton, in his Latin Manuscript of Heraldry, written
before printing was invented (now in my custody), said of
his son, 1440, “Monsieur William Bodrigham port de
Argent trois bends de Gules;” who dying without issue,
his two sisters became his heirs; the one married to
Champernowne, of Halewin, or Haleworth, who in her
right held in this place by the tenure of knight’s service,
<abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> a Knight’s fee of land (Carew’s Survey of
Cornwall).</p>

<p>His other sister, as tradition saith, was married to Trenowith,
who thereupon discontinued his own paternal
name and arms, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field Argent, on a fess Sable,
three chevrons transverse (to the dexter) of the Field; and
assumed those of Bodrigan. He had issue by her Henry
Trenowith, or Bodrigham, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> who married
Jane, sixth daughter of William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke,
<!--112.png--><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
slain 8th Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> 1469, the relict of Thomas
Viscount Lisle, and by her had issue. He was knighted
by King Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> or King Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> by the name
of Sir Henry Bodrigham; who siding with King Richard
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> at the battle of Bosworth Field (where he, the said
King Richard, was slain by the Earl of Richmond’s soldiers),
he was therefore, with many others, attainted of
treason against King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>; and in order to shun
justice he made his escape after the battle aforesaid,
and secretly repaired to this place, where he was kept close
for a season, but not so private but King Henry’s officers
got notice thereof, and at an appointed time beset the same
in quest of him; which he understanding, by a back-door
fled from thence, and ran down the hills to the sea
cliff near the same, the officers pursuing so quick after him
that he could not possibly make his escape. As soon
therefore as he came to the cliff, about a hundred feet
high, he leaped down into the sea, upon the little grassy
island there, without much hurt or damage; where instantly
a boat which he had prepared in the cove, attended
him there, which transported him to a ship that carried
him into France. Which astonishing fact, and place, is
to this day well known and remembered by the name of
Harry Bodrigan’s leap, or jump. But notwithstanding his
own escape beyond the seas, this lordship and his whole
estate were forfeited and seized by King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> for
attainder of treason; and the greatest part thereof he
settled upon Sir Richard Edgcumb and his heirs for ever;
whose posterity are still in possession thereof. This Sir
Richard Edgcumb, not long before, on suspicion of being
confederated with the Earl of Richmond against King
Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (as tradition saith), was shrewdly sought
after and pursued by means of this very Sir Henry Bodrigan,
in order to be taken into custody, who from his
house at Cotehele, made also a wonderful escape thence,
and got into France, to the Earl of Richmond; of which
see more in Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 114 (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 270,

Lord Dunstanville’s edition), so unavoidable a thing is
fortune or destiny.</p>

<p>Tradition tells us that there was great discord and variance
between the families of Bodrigan and the knightly
family of the Haleps of Lammoran, either upon account of
private affronts or grudges, or upon the different interests
or factions, and wars between the houses of York and
Lancaster, wherein they were associated and engaged
against each other, so that as often as they met between themselves
and servants some combat or battle ensued, whereby
blood was shed and the peace broken; and they often came
to each other’s gates armed in defiance on horseback.</p>

<p>At Tre-garden lived John de Tregarthyn, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> how long before I know not; after which his
posterity in this place married with the great inheritrixes
of Pever, Chamberlayne, and Hendower, of Court, in
Branell, by which last, by the Cornwalls of that place,
they were lineally descended from Richard Earl of Cornwall,
King of the Romans, by his concubine, Joan de
Valletort, widow of Sir Alexander Oakeston. (Vide <span class="sc"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen</span>’s.) Certainly this was an ancient, rich, and
famous family in those parts, for it appears by their seats,
or pews, in Goran church, they had the precedence or
right hand of the seats pertaining to the great family of
Bodrigan, as is yet to be seen. Thomas Tregarthyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
was Sheriff of Cornwall, 7 Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1492, who
married Hendower aforesaid, and removed to Court, in
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, in Branell. He had issue by her, John
Tregarthyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and two daughters; Margaret, the eldest,
married to Richard Whiteleigh, of Efford, in Devon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
Sheriff of that county 16th Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>; from whose two
daughters and heirs the Grenvilles of Stowe, and the
Halses late of Efford aforesaid, and Fentongallan, in Cornwall,
are lineally descended. Catherine, the second daughter
of Thomas Tregarthyn, was married to John Carmenow,
of Fentongollan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 5th Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
whose posterity are extinct.</p>

<p><!--114.png--><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
John Tregarthyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> aforesaid, son of Thomas, married
Jane, daughter of Thomas Trethyrfe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and had issue
by her four daughters that became his heirs; Mary married
to Degory Grenvill, of Penheale, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; Jane to Tripcony,
who passed those lands to Richard Trevanion, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
(ancestor to Richard Trevanion, now in possession of this
place); Margaret, married to George Tanner, of Cullumbton,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> to whose share and partage the manor of Court
and Branell, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, fell; Joan married to John
Kellaway, of Egge, in Devon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; after his death to
Wadham of Merryfield, in Somerset, as appears from her
tombstone in Branscombe church, Devonshire, where is
to be read and seen those words:</p>

<p>“Here lyeth the body of a virtuous and ancient gentlewoman,
descended of the ancient house of the Plantagenets,
some time of Cornwall, namely, Joan, one of the daughters
and coheirs of John Tregarthin, of Tregarthyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; she was
first married to John Kellaway, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who had by her much
issue. After his death she was married to John Wadham,
of Meryfield, in the county of Somerset, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by whom
she had children. She lived a virtuous and godly life, and
died in an honourable age, in the year of our Lord 1581.”
Now because this dark phrase, “descended of the house of
the Plantagenets,” needs a clavis to unlock it, let the reader
view the history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s in Branell, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen’s by Saltash, and he shall find one that will do it
effectually. The arms of Tregarthin, whose name and
whole family is now extinct, were, Argent, a chevron between
three escallops Sable.</p>

<p>The present possessor of this barton is Richard Trevanion,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married Bond, of Earth; who had issue
by her one only daughter, married to Peter Major, of
Foye, merchant, now in possession thereof, whose names
are the same as the Trevanions of Caryhayes.</p>

<p>Trewoola, Tre-wolla, or Tre-wole, gave name and origin
to an old family of gentlemen surnamed de Trewolla;
who, in allusion to their names, gave for their arms, Sable,
three owls. This estate, in the latter end of the reign of
<!--115.png--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was sold to Charles Trevanion, of Cary-Hayes,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> for 900<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> by John Trewolla, gentleman, attorney-at-law,
which was the last parcel of land Trewolla had to sell
of a considerable estate elsewhere, formerly sold by his
ancestors; and this place was so depressed with mortgages,
statutes, and judgments, that the whole consideration-money
fell much short of paying his creditors, and the
incumbrances that were upon it; so that, in order to make
a clear title to the purchaser, several of Trewolla’s creditors
came to a loss, and in particular, James Hals, of Merthyr,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> and Martha his wife, who had a statute staple for 700<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
on those lands, who, to comply with Trewolla’s bad circumstances,
on Mr. Trevanion’s paying them 250<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> he and his
wife levied a fine thereon, and executed a deed, then declaring
the uses thereof to be for the only use of the said
Charles Trevanion, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> his heirs and assigns for ever.</p>

<p>In this parish, at &mdash;&mdash;, was the dwelling of my
very kind friend Dr. James Gibbs, third son of James Gibbs,
Vicar of this parish, who had his education in Exeter College,
as a servitor to his kinsman Mr. Davis, son to Dr.
Davis late of Plymouth; where, after he had taken his
Bachelor’s degree, he declared for the study of physic in
Oxford; and soon after, to better his study and experience,
went with the said Mr. Davis into France, and fixed at
Montpelier, where he practised physic (and also surgery
in an hospital, as himself informed me) for several years;
afterwards in the College of Physicians there took his degree
of Doctor of that science; and, lastly, returned to
this place, where he practised physic with admirable care,
skill, and success, and through multitudes of patients and
moderate fees, hath purchased a considerable estate. Since
the writing hereof this gentleman, to the great grief and
loss of his country, departed this life of the hemorrhoides
sickness; and before his death (who for many years had
been his patient, to the great benefit of my health, by God’s
blessing, after the endeavours of all other physicians proved
ineffectual,) left me this legacy,&mdash;that if I myself or friends
<!--116.png--><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
were sick, and had occasion to make use of physic, that we
should in all distempers make use only of the common,
plain, and natural remedies.</p>

<p>Anthony Wills, of this parish, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> farmer of the
sheaf thereof, having by misfortune much incumbered his
estate with debts, quitted the same at such time as the
Prince of Orange landed with his forces at Torbay, and
presented himself and his six or seven sons to that Prince,
for soldiers of war in his army; which proposal was graciously
accepted; and they were all posted as officers of
command in his bands, or troops. And after the Coronation
of this Prince, King William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> they followed him
in all his Flanders and Irish wars against King James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
and King Lewis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr> and discharged their trusts with
such great care, faithfulness, valour, and conduct, that (as
I am informed,) before their deaths they all arrived to the
dignities of Captains, and some of them to the authority or
commands of Majors, Colonels, and one of them to become
a standing Major-General of the field. Who afterwards,
about the year <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 1714, being made principal commander
of the army and troops of horse of King George
the First, against the Pretender’s (James Henry Edward
Stewart,) army at Preston, in Lancashire, where, after a
furious, violent, and bloody battle with them, he obtained
the victory over that pretended Prince’s forces; for which
fact, and other noble deeds, he was created a Baronet of
England, and is since made General of all the land forces
in England next the King, his salary amounting to 7000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
per annum, as reported.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>For the name, I take it to be a contraction of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gordian,
pronounced in Cornwall <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gorian, who having
been, like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, a violent prosecutor of the Christians,
became a proportionably zealous convert, and was beheaded
at Rome in the year 341.</p>

<p><!--117.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
A tradition in the parish, nevertheless, assigns the
guardianship of this church to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gorien, or Coren, one
of the missionaries from Ireland who accompanied <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Perran.</p>

<p>The name of Trevennen, or Tremenen, probably the
town of birth, in reference to its fertility, belonged to the
Priory of Tywardrith, and formed a part of the lands given
by Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> to the Duchy in exchange for the manor
of Wallingford.</p>

<p>Adjoining to Trevennen, and within the manor, is Trevasens,
which was long the seat of a family of the same
name, but passed to the Hoblyns of Nanswydan, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Columb, through an heiress.</p>

<p>Polgorror was heretofore a country residence of the
Provost of Glasnith College, at Penryn, to which the great
tithes were impropriated. This place, with the great
tithes and the advowson of the vicarage, now belong to the
bishopric of Exeter.</p>

<p>Adjoining to this is Treveor, the great town, or dwelling,
formerly the seat of Treveors; and the parishioners still
talk of Sir Henry Treveor, who lived here; and a part of
his house is yet standing.</p>

<p>Pennore, or Penarth. I take nore to signify the same
as in Saxon, a promontory; and that it is here applied
to a point jutting out into the sea, namely, to the Dead-man,
which is separated from the village by a double intrenchment,
yet pretty entire, running from cliff to cliff, and
cutting off about an hundred acres of coarse ground. The
intrenchment is about twenty feet broad and twenty-four
feet high in most places; but the outer wall is the least
high. The people call it Thica Vosa, which is the Vallum,
and the Hack and Cast, fabling it to be the work of a giant,
who performed the whole in one night. They show also a hole
in the cliff which opens into a hollow below, formed by the
sea; and the people relate that this giant growing unwell,
applied to a physician, who, that he might rid the world of
such a monster, bled him near this spot, and recommended
<!--118.png--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
him to let the blood flow into this hole till it became full.
The giant did so, and bled himself to death, when his
body fell over on a rock, still called the giant’s house.
The hole thus attempted to be filled with blood is denominated
from the immense quantity of ivy growing round
it.</p>

<p>The church is placed very conveniently in the middle
of the parish. It is well built, with a handsome square
tower of hewn moor stone, with four tunable bells; and
by reason of its high situation this church is seen from a
great distance. It consists of a large lofty nave, one south
aile of the same length, and two cross ailes to the north, of
which one is but small. In the chancel, near the north wall,
before the communion table, is a plain marble stone, on
which are seen the hollows where the figure of a woman
kneeling, with arms, inscription, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> must have been inlaid.
Tradition calls it the tomb of Lady Brannell, but
who this Lady Brannell was is unknown, although some
conjectures are formed of her belonging to the family of
Tregarthen.</p>

<p>Against the eastern wall, by the window, is a comely
monument of black marble, to Richard Edgecombe, of
Bodrigan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> son of Sir Richard Edgecombe, of Mount
Edgecombe, Knight, who died <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 5, 1755.</p>

<p>The manor of Trevascus belongs by purchase to Mr.
Slade Gulby, who resides on the barton of Trevenion,
which has been in his family since the time of the Tudors.</p>

<p>Treveor belonged to the late <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Wynne, and was
given by him to Mr. Pendarves. On this barton may be
seen one of those round entrenchments usually denominated
castles in the West of England. It is at least doubtful
in most cases whether any permanent dwelling was ever
connected with them.</p>

<p>The barton of Bodrigan has descended in the family of
Edgecombe since the time of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></p>

<p><!--119.png--><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
It is generally apprehended that Sir Henry Bodrigan
was present at the battle of Bosworth Field; and that,
having escaped from thence to Cornwall, he endeavoured
to defend his property in a private house against Edgecombe
and Trevenion, who, in despoiling and endeavouring
to take his life, did no more than he would have done, had
the fortune of arms inclined the other way; or than what he
actually did against Sir Richard Edgecombe a few years before
at Cotehele. Such are the effects of civil wars, when<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Bodrugon’s property was mainly divided between Edgecumbe
and Trevanion, who are also believed to have fought
against King Richard in Bosworth Field, and then to have
attacked Sir Richard Bodrugon near his own house after
the defeat at that place. He effected his retreat to a vessel
by the extraordinary effort already mentioned, and left the
shores of England never to return. He had a brother
settled in the north of Devon, but his line became soon
extinct.</p>

<p>The portion of this parish around the church, and the
various insulated portions, are situated on magnesian
rocks; the most abundant variety of which is serpentine.
This rock is generally of a red colour, but this is evidently
in some cases derived from a partial chemical change. In
its perfect state this serpentine is generally of a dark-green,
with shining scales of diallage, which are commonly of a
bronze colour, and at other times of a fine green. The
serpentine at Cadgwith may be seen to pass gradually into
a schistose rock of a dark bottle-green, and very glassy and
spangled on the surface of its lamellæ. This slate is generally
called greenstone, but it differs therefrom, and
consequently requires a distinct appellation. At Cagar
there is a quarry in the serpentine; and at Kennick Cove
adjoining, many varieties of these rocks may be obtained.</p>

Lelant.)</p>

<p>By virtue whereof the Prior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s and his
successors were possessed of this manor from that time till
the 26th Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> 1536, when that Priory was dissolved,
and the lands thereof vested in the crown. At
which time King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> gave the lands thereof to
Champernown, Beaumont, Barry, and others; and to
Beaumont’s and Barry’s share fell this manor of Laneseley;
who parted with it either by purchase or in marriage with
his daughter, to John Tripcony, about the year 1565;
whose son, John Tripcony, having by riot and excess comparatively
wasted his paternal estate, mortgaged this manor
of Laneseley to Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongollan, knight,
about the year 1620, who was lineally descended from
Simon de Als, aforesaid, and died seised thereof about the
year 1637. After his decease his unthrifty son and heir,
John Hals, became possessed thereof, who assigned the
mortgage thereof for 500<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> to one Mr. Downes, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr>
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
1655; and soon after, having spent his whole paternal
estate elsewhere, went beyond the seas, and was never
since heard of to this day; leaving issue, by Jane Arundel
his wife, Major Thomas Hals, of Hals’s Savana, in Clarendon
parish and province, in Jamaica, who had issue Thomas
Hals, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> his son and heir.</p>

<p>After the departure of the said John Hals beyond the
seas, the said Mr. Downes assigned over the mortgage of
the premises to one Mr. Collwell, a scrivener of London;
who dying soon after, his son, Thomas Collwell, became
seised thereof; and after his death his widow, who by her
last will and testament (as executrix of her said husband,)
conveyed the said manor to Charles Bonython, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>&mdash;Spur,
Longeville, and others, in trust, now in possession thereof,
1700; before which time, between the said Downes and
Collwell, on pretence of the equity of redemption reserved
in Downes, John Hals being beyond the seas, and that the
mortgage money to Collwell was satisfied out of the profits
of these lands; and a cross bill of Collwell’s against
Downes, alleging the contrary, and to foreclose him; happened
so many tedious and costly Chancery suits as comparatively
undid them both. But, maugre all their endeavours,
the old titles of Tripcony and Hals were foreclosed
by a decree in Chancery, betwixt Downes and Collwell,
in Hillary term 1689, yet extant and to be seen.</p>

<p>This manor of Laneseley, for goodness of land, jurisdiction,
court leet, fishing craft, and royalties over all that
part of the sea of the Mount’s Bay, between Longbridge and
Chiandower, near Penzance, may equal, if not surpass, any
other manor in those parts of its value, which is now scarcely
worth 300<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, though in former ages it was of far
larger extent; for in the survey of Cornish acres, tempore
Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> (Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 46, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 131, of
Lord Dunstanville’s edition), it was numbered in the Exchequer
to contain twenty-eight acres, that is, about six
thousand statute acres;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> every ancient Cornish acre being
<!--125.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
sixty statute acres of land; the contents of the whole now
not exceeding a thousand statute acres, which lies in Gulval
and Ludgvan.</p>

<p>In Fosses Moor, part of this manor of Lanesely, in this
parish, is that well-known fountain called Gulval Well.
To which place great numbers of people, time out of mind,
have resorted for pleasure and profit of their health, as the
credulous country people do in these days, not only to
drink the waters thereof, but to inquire after the life or
death of their absent friends; where, being arrived, they
demanded the question at the well, whether such a person,
by name, be living, in health, sick, or dead; if the party
be living, and in health, the still quiet water of the well-pit,
as soon as the question is demanded, will instantly
bubble or boil up as a pot, clear christaline water; if sick,
foul and puddle waters; if the party be dead, it will neither
bubble, boil up, or alter its colour or still motion. However,
I can speak nothing of the truth of those supernatural
facts from my own sight or experience, but write from the
mouths of those who told me they had seen and proved
the veracity thereof. Finally, it is a strong and courageous
fountain of water, kept neat and clean by an old woman of
the vicinity, to accommodate strangers for her own advantage,
by blazing the virtues and divine qualities of those
waters.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>After copying from Hals, Mr. Tonkin adds of Lanistley
manor:&mdash;It extendeth throughout the parish of Gulval
from the Moreps to the Gundrons; that is to say, from
above the sea to the Down Hills; it extendeth also through
a part of the parish of Ludgvan.</p>

<p>At Kenneggy is the dwelling, by lease (the fee being in
his elder brother, William Harris, of Hayne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>), of
Christopher Harris, Gentleman, an attorney-at-law, who
married a daughter of John Foote, of Truro, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> His
<!--126.png--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
elder brother, who married the daughter of John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Aubyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Clowance, in the parish of Crowan, is
now in possession of Hayne, near Lifton, in Devonshire,
having succeeded to it on the decease of Sir Arthur Harris,
<abbr title="junior">jun.</abbr> the last heir male of the elder branch. On removing
to Hayne he leased Kenneggy to his younger brother
aforesaid; who, by reason of the elder brother’s yet want
of issue, is likely to become his heir. The arms of Harris
are, Sable, within a bordure three crescents Argent.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Llwyd, in his letter to me, would have this
parish to take its name from the inscription on the stone in
Maddern parish, “Riolabran: Cunoval: Fil:” and that
Cunoval is turned by corruption into Guloval, for that he
found many such instances in Wales.</p>

<p>I should be glad to agree with so great a critic, but since
there is a saint, or bishop, whose name comes very near
to this&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gunwall, whose memory the church celebrates
on the 6th of June, I cannot forbear fancying, especially
the humour of the country being considered, that he is the
patron and the namer of this parish.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>There cannot be any reasonable doubt of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gunwall
having bestowed his name on this parish, more especially
when the prophetic well is taken into account, since saints
scarcely ever failed of imparting some supernatural quality
to their favourite streams.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gunwall was, moreover, a Briton, and is stated to
have been in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Saint Gudwall, or Gunwall, was born in Wales about
the year 500. Being entirely devoted to God, he collected
eighty-eight monks in a little island called Plecit, being no
more than a rock surrounded by water. For some reason,
however, he abandoned this establishment, and passed
by sea into Cornwall; and from thence he went into Devonshire,
<!--127.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
where he betook himself to the most holy, perfect,
and useful state of a solitary anchorite; at length, however,
again emerging, he sailed into Britany, and there succeeded
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Malo, as Bishop of that see, although he is said even
then to have dwelt in a solitary cell, and to have died there
at a very advanced age. His relics have been widely distributed,
and various places in France have been called by
his name.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker explains the ancient name of this parish,
Lanisley, by Lan and Ishei, low, or lower, the low church,
which appears to agree very well with the situation.</p>

<p>The great tithes certainly belonged to the Priory at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
German’s, for in the returns made to Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> of the
property belonging to them, appears<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Gulval, decimæ Garbarum, £10. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>These tithes, since the law-suits mentioned by Mr. Hals,
have passed by purchase into the possession of the Beauchamps
of Gwenap, and now belong to the two daughters
and coheiresses of the late Mr. John Beauchamp.</p>

<p>The vicarage, although it has risen into one of the most
valuable to be found in that district, in consequence of
modern improvements, and of its being situated near Penzance,
is yet rated under twenty pounds a-year in the
King’s Books, and therefore passes by the presentation of
the Lord Chancellor. Two Mr. <a name="err3" id="err3"></a>Pennerks, father and son,
held this living in succession. It was then given, in 1789,
to Mr. John Cole, afterwards Doctor in divinity and Rector
of Exeter College, and his successor is the present
Vicar, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Dillon.</p>

<p>Kenegie passed from Mr. William Harris, of Hayne,
accordingly as Mr. Tonkin had conjectured, to the family
of his brother, Mr. Christopher Harris; and the family
becoming extinct in the male line by the death of this
gentleman’s grandson in 1775, by much the largest part
of the estate went, under the provisions of a will, to Mr.
William Arundell, then resident at Crane, in Camborne,
who assumed the name of Harris; but his grandson
<!--128.png--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
choosing to fix his permanent residence at a very handsome
seat of his own creating near Lifton, parted with
all his Cornish property; and Kenegie now belongs, in
fee, to the farmer, who had occupied it at an annual rent.
This place having formerly belonged to the family of &mdash;&mdash;
Tripcony, who bore for their arms, Argent, three rabbits
passant Sable, and kynin and kyninger being the Cornish
names for a rabbit, I cannot but suspect that kynneggy, or
kenegie, must have some relation to the name of Tripeney.</p>

<p>Trevailer is the place next of importance in this parish. It
has been long the residence of a very respectable family, the
Veales. They are said to have come from Gloucestershire,
their ancestor having been the first Protestant Vicar of
Gulval. The Reverend William Veale, the present
possessor, has rebuilt the house; the second brother of his
grandfather, Mr. George Veale, made a large fortune at
Penzance, by the practice of the law and by success in
mines, which became divided between three daughters who
married Hichens, Baines, and Jenkins. Mr. William
Veale has married the only daughter of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard
Gerveys Grylls, of Helston.</p>

<p>But the most beautiful place in this parish, and one of
the greatest ornaments to the whole neighbourhood, is
Rosemorron, the Vale of Blackberries, formed by Mr.
George John. This gentleman having married Jane, the
eldest daughter of Mr. Arundall, who assumed the name
of Harris on succeeding to the large fortune of that family,
and having been for many years at the head of his profession
in Penzance, has at length retired to this delightful
spot in the summer months. Nor have his decorations of
the country been confined to one situation; he has shewn,
by extensive plantations at Try, that the most elevated and
barren tracts, even on a granite soil, may be rendered useful
and decorative by the growth of trees.</p>

<p>The lower part of the parish, adjoining to the sea, is
fertile in the highest degree, from the village of Chiandower
<!--129.png--><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
(the house by the water), through Pendrea to the
Church Town. And the vallies, abounding in trees, rival
those of any country. Chiandower is also become a place
worthy of the adjacent scenery, through the taste and the
exertions of Messrs. Bolitho, who, in making ample fortunes,
have benefited the country still more than themselves by
promoting every species of productive industry. The parish
feast does not certainly corroborate the supposition of the
patron saint; it is held on the nearest Sunday to the 12th
of November, the day of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin, the first Pope of that
name, a native of Todi, in Tuscany, and elected Pope in
the year 649. He assembled in the same year the sixth
council of Lateran, where the heresy of the Monothelites
was condemned; but the schismatic Emperor, Constans,
sent Olympius, his chamberlain, to Rome, to support the
obnoxious sect, who arrived there while the council were
deliberating; and failing in his attempts to divert them
from supporting the orthodox faith, he suborned a person
to murder the Pope, but in attempting to execute the atrocious
deed the assassin was miraculously struck blind. Yet,
nevertheless, Constans persevered in his speculative errors
and in his wicked conduct, by causing <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin to be
seized, and after suffering many casualties, to be banished
to the Tauric Chersonesus, where he died in 655.</p>

<p>His relics were afterwards brought to Rome, and deposited
in the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin of Tours, on the 12th of
November, which, from thenceforward, was observed as a
festival to his honour.</p>

<p>The day of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin of Tours, the popular patron of
beggars, happens to be on the day before, and several
parishes give their feasts on the nearest Sunday to November
the 11th, but Gulval alone honours the Pope and
Saint.</p>

<p>Gulval measures 3950 statute acres.</p>

<p>The northern part of this parish rests on granite, which
is for the most part a coarse crystalline rock, containing
very large porphyritic crystals of felspar. The granite is,
however, in some places very fine-grained, and near its
juncture with the slate abounds in shorl. The schistose
rocks composing the southern part of the parish, have a
basis of compact felspar, assuming various appearances according
as it is more or less siliceous; those rocks are often
beautifully marked with crystalline patches and veins of
actynolite, as may be seen in the rocks on the sea shore,
and they are traversed here and there by beds of felspar
porphyry, into which they gradually pass.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker remarks in a note on Hal’s <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> that the
name of this parish is clearly derived from its patron saint,
Winnwallo.</p>

<p>I find that Winwallo was the son of a petty Prince in
Wales; who, flying with his family from the Saxons, went
into Britany, where he acquired the habit of undergoing
monastic austerities under the guidance of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Budock. He
ultimately founded a monastery called Landevenech, about
three miles from Brest. He became the first Abbat, and
died on the <abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> of March about the year 529. His body
was buried at Landevenech; but in after ages, when the
northmen extended their ravages to this part of the Continent,
his relics were removed to places of greater safety;
and as an effectual security against an entire loss, portions
were preserved at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s, at Blandinberg, at Ghent, at
Montreuil, and at other places.</p>

<p>The Celtic name has given origin to various pronunciations,
and to as many corresponding orthographies; the
G and W at the beginning of words are well known to take
<!--132.png--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
each the place of the other almost without discrimination.
In Picardy, where he is esteemed the patron, Winwallo
is changed into Vignevaley and Walovay; in Britany into
Guignole and Vennole; in other parts of France into
Guingalois.</p>

<p>It is the more probable that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winwallo may be the
patron saint of this parish, and that he may have given it his
name, since a parish in the neighbourhood stands in that
relation towards his teacher <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Budock. The parish feast,
however, is held on the last Sunday in April, although <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Winwallo is honoured in the Roman calendar on the third
of March.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says that the manor of Wynyaton, or Winington,
called by Mr. Hals Gonwallowinton, was given about
the year 1235, by Roger Earl of Cornwall, in exchange for
Bossiney, to Gervase de Harnington; from whom it passed
by an heiress to the family of Trevanthians, and again in
the same way to Roskymers. It ultimately belonged to the
Arundells till the general sale of all Lord Arundell’s property
in Cornwall, when this manor was purchased by Mr.
John Rogers, of Penrose, near Helston.</p>

<p>The church is situated among sandbanks, and very near
the sea. In those banks Captain Avery, the celebrated
buccaneer, is reported to have buried several chests of
treasure previously to his leaving England on the voyage
from which he never returned. So strongly has this opinion
prevailed, that Mr. John Knill, collector of the customs at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, procured, about the year 1770, a grant of treasure
trove, and expended some money in a fruitless search.</p>

<p>This gentleman is still remembered on account of his
singularities, and his having erected a pyramid on a hill near
the town where he had long resided.</p>

<p>In the churchyard of Gunwallo is a tombstone with the
following conceit:</p>

<p>This parish runs parallel with the sea shore from Poljew
Cove to Loo Bar. The shore, where the land lies
low, is covered with banks of siliceous sand, which near the
church form an extensive down. At the Cove the rocks
consist of a blue glassy slate, and of a compost rock of the
same colour which decomposes into a white clay. Nearly
the whole of the cliff is a diluvial mass; the lower part of
which, just above high-water mark, is consolidated into a
conglomerate sandstone, apparently through the cementing
medium of a solution of carbonate of iron, derived from
the percolation of rain-water through the bed of ferruginous
clay that forms the upper part of this deposit.</p>

<p>Trefyns (i. e. the springs of water, or fountains town,)
came to Beauchamp by marriage with the heiress of this
name and land, where they have ever since flourished in
gentle degree. The present possessor, William Beauchamp,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married Courtney of Trehane, his father
Boaden, his grandfather Tregoze, giveth for his arms,
Vairy Argent and Azure. The first progenitor of the
tribe and name of Beauchamp came into England a
soldier under William the Conqueror, and probably some
of his posterity were planted in this province, from whence
those gentlemen are descended; especially if the name,
Stephen de Bellocampo, 40th Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> who held in
Cornwall by tenure of knight’s service 15<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum land
and rents, may be interpreted the same as Beauchamp
(Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 40), for otherwise verily
I know not from what family of gentlemen those Beauchamps
are descended; since none other of that name give
the same arms as these do; for Guy de Beauchamp, Sheriff
of Devon, 12th King John, gave for his arms, Gules, a fess
between three crosses bottony Or; from whom are descended
the Beauchamps of Bletsho and Hatch, in Wiltshire.
Beauchamp Earl of Warwick gave for his arms,
Gules, a fess between six cross-crosslets Or. William
Beauchamp, Sheriff of Devon 18th Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> that married
the inheritrix of Henry de Ties, lord of Alverton and
Tywarnhayle, summoned to Parliament as a Baron <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> gave for his arms, Gules, a fess between six
martlets Or; from whence I gather there were diverse
families of those Beauchamps heretofore in England, no
way related in blood to each other. Query, whether the
arms of those gentlemen living in this place be not the
<!--135.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
arms of Bochym, as I have been informed they are, which is
Vaire Argent and Azure.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this place of Trefyns was heretofore
denominated from springs of water abounding there in
winter season, yet I assure you now in summer time, by
reason of the tin-mines and subterranean adits near it
that carry those springs of water invisibly under ground,
water is very scarce and much wanting in those lands.
It is also called Trevense, and Trewince.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye chapel in this parish was heretofore a chapel
of ease to Gwenap; the tutelar guardian whereof is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Dye, of Gaul, very famous in that country for his piety
and holy Christian living about the fifth century, who held
the faith in opposition to Arianism and Pelagianism, then
raging in the church. And there is a church in the province
of Lorraine still bearing his name. If it were as
easy for the Vicar to attend and perform divine service
in this remote quarter of the parish where this chapel is,
as it is convenient to his parishioners in the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye,
it had been doubtless still applied to the end and use for
which it was erected.</p>

<p>Not far from this place is that unparalleled and inexhaustible
tin-work called Paldys; i. e. the top or head of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye’s Town, which for above forty years’ space hath
employed yearly from eight hundred to a thousand men
and boys, labouring for and searching after tin in that
place, where they have produced and raised up for that
time yearly, at least twenty thousand pounds worth of that
commodity, to the great enriching of the lords of the soil,
the bound owners, and adventurers in those lands.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Memorandum.</span>&mdash;On Friday, 19th September, 1707,
about four of the clock in the afternoon, happened in those
parts divers flashes of lightning and cracks of thunder,
which not only terrified the inhabitants thereof, but after
one of those cracks a ball of fire, or Jupiter’s thunderbolt
(as the Greeks called it), entered by the window into the
house of one John Kent, a carpenter of this parish, where he
was working, the windy force thereof instantly struck him
dead on the place, scalded his wife and two children in that
room, then passed out through the chimney wall, and so
shattered the same that a great part of it instantly fell to
the ground.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKINS.</p>

<p>In this parish, on the top of a lofty mountain called
Carne-mark, are two or three stone tumuli, under which
are doubtless interred the bodies of some distinguished
persons.</p>

<p>The right name of this parish is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenep, a female
saint, to whom the parish is dedicated.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Saint Wenep is, I believe, only remembered by the
dedication of this parish; but <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye is a personage of
<!--137.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
more consequence. He was a native of France, and in the
year 655 became Bishop of Nevres; but <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye happened
to live at a period when the prevalent fanaticism
induced persons to believe that the Author of all good was
most gratified by beholding the misery of his rational
creatures, accompanied by their voluntary debasements
through ignorance and solitude below the level of the brute
creation. With this persuasion, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye resigned his
bishopric, and founded a house for monks at a place called
Jointures, but retired himself to an anchorite cell. He
is said to have died on the 19th of June, 680.</p>

<p>The chapel, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye, in Gwenap, had long
been in ruins; but since the eager contest has grown up
between the Establishment and Dissenters for retaining or
acquiring power through the media of extensive education
and proselytism, and Chapels, Meeting Houses, and Schools
have arisen all over England, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dye has seen a new
and spacious building displace the ruins that remained
from former times.</p>

<p>The Beauchamps had removed from Trewince to Pengreap;
where the family became extinct in the male
line about the year 1818, by the decease of Mr. Joseph
Beauchamp, who had lost his only son a few years before,
and the estate is now divided between the two daughters
of his elder brother, Mr. John Beauchamp.</p>

<p>Cornmarth has been already mentioned. Mr. Whitaker
says that the true name is Cornmarke, and that it means
the Knight’s barrow.</p>

<p>On the southern declivity of Cornmarth is a large excavation,
supposed by some to have been made long ago for
the exhibition of games, but by others to owe its general
form to the accidental running together of an old mine.
It is, at all events, admirably adapted to the purpose of
enabling a speaker to address an extremely large assembly;
and the late Mr. John Wesley has been distinctly heard by
many thousands at a time in Gwenap pit.</p>

<p><!--138.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
Scornier, which a few years since exhibited the appearance
of a small village, has now become perhaps the chief
place in this parish. Mr. John Williams, one of the most
extensive and most successful managers and adventurous
miners of the present time, built here an excellent house,
and adorned it with the finest collection of Cornish minerals
ever brought together. Mr. Williams, after making a
large fortune, has retired at an advanced age, leaving
several sons engaged in the same pursuits with equal advantage
to themselves and to the public; one of whom has
added a second splendid house to the village.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible for me to enter fully into a
description of the mines, which have continued in work
on the most extensive scale from the period when Mr.
<a name="Lemon" id="Lemon"></a>Leman commenced the modern system up to the present
time. It is said that no district of the same extent in any
part of the world ever produced so much riches.</p>

<p>Poldice was worked for tin about the commencement of
the last century by Mr. Hearle, of Penryn. The mine
happened to have very little water, and this was exhausted
by <a name="rack" id="rack"></a>rock and chain pumps moved by human labour.</p>

<p>Copper seldom appears near the surface, as is the case
with tin; but tin lodes out of granite frequently produce
copper in depth. All the lodes in Gwenap have done
so, and in some places the mines have gone to the depth
of two hundred and thirty or forty fathoms from the surface,
more than two hundred fathoms under the level of
the sea, assisted by steam engines having working-cylinders
ninety inches in diameter and ten feet long.</p>

<p>The freehold of the land containing those mines is possessed
in undivided shares between several persons; Mr.
Hearle had one-third, that is now divided again into thirds
between the descendants of three daughters, Mr. Tremayne,
Mr. Rodd, and Mr. Stephens.</p>

<p>The church in Gwenap is large in every dimension, but,
what is very unusual, the tower stands apart. One of our
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
late historians very justly complains of what he terms the
“mangling of modern Vandalism,” in alterations of the
church; Venetian frames have been substituted for stone
mullions; windows of painted glass bearing the figures of
saints have been removed; and the screen, or rood-loft,
of beautiful workmanship has disappeared; modern deal
seats have been introduced throughout the church, and a
glare of light on the white-washed walls has completed the
overthrow of very thing venerable.</p>

<p>The interior is divided into a nave, a chancel, and two
side ailes, supported on each side by seven handsome
columns.</p>

<p>The burial-ground contains a monument of fine marble
in memory of the Beauchamps.</p>

<p>There is a tradition in the parish of monks having been
established in the church tower, and that a house now converted
to an inn, was a part of the building. No notice
whatever is taken of such a monastery in any authentic
work. If therefore this tradition rests on any fact, the
house cannot have been more than an hostelry for friars.</p>

<p>The parish measures 5,289 statute acres.</p>

<p>Gwenap has long been one of the most important mining
districts of Cornwall. Its western part rests on the same
<!--140.png--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
patch of granite as the eastern part of Cornborne, the one
stretching to the east and the other to the west. The slate
is also similar to that of Cornborne, and like that it is traversed
by numerous beds of porphyry, some of which, in
the vicinity of Burncoose, are of the most beautiful description,
containing well-defined crystals of felspar and of
quartz.</p>

<p>All the lands in this parish lie within the great duchy,

for distinction from Helston in Trigg. The church is
certainly called Wendron, from its female patroness.</p>

the same as eglis, a church, from which it is not far distant.
There are two houses adjacent so called, Bodilly Veor and
Bodilly Vear, the great and the little. Bodilly Veor was
the seat of Thomas Tresilian, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> descended from the

<p>It appears that the vicarage of Wendron, and perhaps
the endowed portion of the great tithes, belonged to Rewley
Abbey, near Oxford, founded by Edmund Earl of
Cornwall, in compliance with an injunction of his father
Richard Earl of Cornwall; although Richard himself
seems to have commenced the foundation, for a manuscript
history in the Cotton Library says,</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Frater enim hujus regis (Henrici tertii) Ricardus primus

<p>This advowson had passed through various hands till it
was assigned by Mr. Matthew Wills, of Helston, on whose
decease, in 1782, it came to his son, Mr. Thomas Wills.
This gentleman, although not intended for the church, had
received his education at Winchester and Oxford, and the
living happening to become vacant just at the period of
his father’s death, Mr. Wills was induced to take holy
orders, and he is now (1834) the Incumbent; but the
advowson has been transferred to Queen’s College, Oxford,
for its Michell or new foundation; thus returning almost
to the very spot where it was bestowed almost six hundred
years before.</p>

<p>The barton of Trenethick is traced back to the family of
Seneschalls, from whom it came by a marriage to the
Hills; the last of whom, Mr. John Hill, gave it by will,
about seventy years since, to a family long seated in Constantine,
of the same name, but, from their bearing different
arms, probably not related.</p>

<p>Nansloe, the vale leading to the lake, is beautifully
situated in a valley near the Loo. It has been for
some time the seat of the Robinsons, since they removed
there from Bochim in Cury. The last representative
of this family in the male line was the late Reverend
William Robinson, Vicar of Crowan.</p>

<p>Trelil belonged to Mr. Rowe, steward to Lord Godolphin.
His only daughter and eventual heiress married Mr. William
Harris, of Rosewarne, in Camburne, Sheriff of Cornwall
in the year 1773; and their only daughter, married to
Winchcombe Hartley, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Berkshire, is its present
possessor.</p>

<p>This parish has for ages been one of the most productive
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
of tin in the whole county; and before the improved
operations of smelting had placed all ores nearly on the
same level as to the quality of their products, the neighbourhood
of Porkellis boasted of producing the best tin in
Cornwall.</p>

<p>The church is situated nearly at one extremity of this
immense parish, and has nothing to distinguish it but a
monument to the memory of Warin Penhallinyk, a prebendary
of the monastery at Penryn, Rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just,
in Roseland, Vicar of Wendron and of the adjoining
parish, Stithyans. The Vicarage-house is a mere hovel.
The parish feast is on the nearest Sunday to October the
28th, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Simon and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jude.</p>

<p>Mr. Jago, Vicar of Wendron, was perhaps the last
clergyman in the west of Cornwall supposed to exercise
supernatural powers; various anecdotes were current about
him sixty years ago, and then generally believed; all I
apprehend to his credit, being such as laying spirits, discovering
thieves, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> mixed up, however, with frivolities,
as seems ever to have happened in those popular legends.
Whenever parson Jago got off from his horse he struck
the ground with his whip, and a demon immediately appeared
to hold or take care of his horse till he wanted it
again. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell is
descended either from this gentleman or from his
father.</p>

<p>About two-thirds of this extensive parish is situated on
granite, which is the same as that of Camborne, Crowan,
and Sithney adjoining; the other third, which forms the
southern part of the parish, is composed of slate rocks,
which near the granite are felspathic, and clearly referrible
to the porphyritic series; but as the sea is approached, the
character of these slates becomes obscure, such as they
generally are whenever the porphyritic and calcareous
series pass into each other.</p>

<p>The parish of Gwiner has been extremely productive in
copper. Herland Mine, usually called the manor, produced
so large a return to Mr. Hobbin, only part proprietor
of the land, as paid for the building of Nansewidden
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb, about the middle of the last century. It
has been since wrought on a most extensive scale, and to a
great depth.</p>

<p>Whele Alfred, Whele Trelistion, and others, have been
very productive; but at present they are all discontinued.</p>

<p>The family of most consequence connected with this
parish is that of Lanyon.</p>

<p>The first syllable certainly implies an inclosed place,
from which it has become specifically applied to a church,
to a castle, and even to a town. Mr. Hals’ conjectures as
to the termination of the name, appear to be so utterly
groundless that they are omitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker believes that Lanyon in Normandy bears
only a castle for its cognisance, and that the falcon has
been added on account of the similarity in sound of Lanyer
to Lanner, the favourite bird in falconry.</p>

<p>It must be observed however that Lanyon is always in
Cornwall pronounced La-nine.</p>

<p>The Gwinear and Madern branches of the Laryon family
were together possessed of extensive property in the adjacent
parishes; combinations of unfortunate circumstances
have diminished their possessions, but hopes may be entertained
that the Lanyons of Gwinear, who have never
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
lost the sense of what is due to the memory of their ancestors,

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish, like those adjoining, Camborne and Crowan,
has been long celebrated for its mines, but it does not resemble
them by reposing in part on granite, being confined
entirely to rocks of the slate series.</p>

<p>The porphyritic courses are not so common here as in
Gwennap; but they often assume a very interesting form,
occurring as insulated masses, which in some cases are perfectly
granitic, and at the same time afford every indication
of their having been formed contemporaneously with the
slate. The most curious geological phenomenon of this
parish is to be met with in Relistion Mine, where one of
the lodes, (metalliferous veins) at a considerable depth, is
composed of rounded pedules, cemented together in a hard
solid mass; at first sight it would be pronounced to be a
decided conglomerate of derivative origin; but on a more
close examination it is found to have the spheroidal structure,
which is common to many rocks, and which in regard
to this mineral was probably coeval with its original formation.</p>

<p>For in this parish is the voke lands of the great and
privileged manor of Coner, or Conner-ton, which claims
by prescription not only the royalties and jurisdiction within
its limits, but also over the whole hundred of Penwith
(id est, the head tree). Hence it is that this manor
of Connerton is privileged not only with the jurisdiction
of a Court Leet or Baron for the whole hundred of
Penwith, within which two courts are tried all matters of
debt and damage between party and party within the same,
(life, land, and limb excepted,) wherein heretofore infinite
number of causes have been depending, by reason of its
being the most remote part of the kingdom from the Courts
of Westminster; the steward or judge of which courts,
(which offices commonly are vested in one person,) takes his
deputation from the now lord of the manor, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Sir John
Arundell, of Lanherne, Knight, and not from the King or
Duke of Cornwall’s stewards, as other bailiwicks do.</p>

<p>For in the time of King Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> this manor was the
King of England’s or Earl of Cornwall’s lands, who, by
letters patent, yet to be seen at Lanherne, passed it over,
together with the bailiwick of the said hundred, to Simon
Pincerna, or Butler, lord of Lanherne, in consideration
that he the said Simon had enfeoffed the said King Henry,
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
his heirs and successors, with the lordship and manor of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James at Westminster, in the county of Middlesex.
After which exchange or settlement, Pincerna and his heirs
enjoyed this manor for several descents, till Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>’s
days. At which time one of the two daughters and heirs of
Pincerna was married to Arundell of Trenibleth, the direct
ancestor of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, Knight, now
in possession of both those lordships. The other daughter
to Umphravill.</p>

<p>This church is a rectory, daughter to Phillack, together

<p>The Arundells, being Catholics, leased the advowson of
Phillack and Gwithian on lives, to prevent its lapsing to
the University of Oxford, under an Act of Parliament.
On the death of Mr. Edward Collins it did so lapse, and
the University presented Mr. William Glover, of Worcestershire,
first of Balliol College and then a chaplain of All
Souls. A lease was then granted to Mr. Hoskin, of Gwithian,
and his son the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard Hoskin succeeded Mr.
Glover, who on the general sale of all the Arundell property
in Cornwall, purchased the freehold, so that his son
is now patron and incumbent of the united parishes.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says that the advowson of these united parishes
belonged to the Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James in Bristol, and I
find a charter of King Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angliæ, et Dux Normanniæ

de Eglasheil, Ecclesiam de Eglossant, Ecclesiam de
Egloscraweyn, et Capellam de Bennartona, Ecclesiam de
Melioton, et Ecclesiam Sancti Germoch.”</p>

<p>It is understood that the manor of Conorton had in some
way been connected with the honour of Gloucester before
the Conquest. William certainly gave it with that honour
to Alan Earl of Britanny. Rufus had it again to bestow,
<!--152.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
and under his grant it descended to the Earls of Gloucester,
originating in an illegitimate son of King Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> William,
the second of these earls, endowed the Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
James.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says that Robert Earl of Gloucester, son of
this Robert, gave Conorton to Richard Pincerna in 1154,
but he is clearly mistaken, for the date proves it to be done
by the same William. Pincerna is a word used by writers
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mediæ et infimæ Latinitatis</span> for butler. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui vinum convivis

</div>

<p>The son of this Pincerna took the name of Conorton, as
was usual in those times, and settled at Lanherne; from
this family it passed with Lanherne to the Arundells, by
marriage, in whom it continued till the general wreck
above referred to, when being reduced to a mere royalty
it was bought by the late Sir Christopher Hawkins, and
since his decease in 1829 the royalty has been purchased
by an attorney, for the purpose in all probability of holding
the courts.</p>

<p>There is a tradition, supported by the authority of Leland,
that a town so large as to contain two churches stood
on this manor, which has been destroyed by sand; but the
tale must at the least be a very great exaggeration.</p>

<p>The account given by Mr. Hals of the exchange of the
manor of Conorton for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’ in Westminster, can
scarcely be made to quadrate with the above account,
which appears to be authentic, and it is still further opposed
by the history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Hospital, as given by
Tanner and Dugdale, they say:</p>

<p>“At a distance from the city, in the fields near Westminster,
some well disposed citizens of London, beyond the
memory of man, and (as some think) long before the
Conquest, founded a hospital for the reception of fourteen
<!--153.png--><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
leprous women, to whom were afterwards added brethren,
to minister divine service.” This house was dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
James, and rebuilt in the time of King Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p>It was under the government of a master (although the
Abbat of Westminster claimed a jurisdiction over it) till
King Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> granted the perpetual custody of it to
Eton College, who surrendered it to King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
anno Regni 23, (<abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1531) when it was valued at 100<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
per annum, in exchange for Chattisham in Suffolk. On
or near the place where this hospital stood has been since
built the present Royal Palace of St James.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons has been so fortunate as to obtain from the
late rector some information respecting the inundation of
sand, which has devastated a large portion of these two
parishes, extending its ravages wherever the coast is low,
throughout the whole northern space of Cornwall, from
the Land’s End to Devonshire. There has always existed
a traditional account of this inundation, corroborated by
the ecclesiastical valuations, which are far too high for the
actual extent of land, and also said to be confirmed by documents
preserved in the Arundell family, carrying back
the commencement of the evil nearly to the period of their
acquiring the property.</p>

<p>With respect to more recent inundations, Mr. Hoskin in
stated to Mr. Lysons, that the barton of Upton, one of
the principal farms, was suddenly overwhelmed; that his
great-grandfather remembered the occupier residing in the
farmhouse, which was nearly buried in one night, the family
being obliged to make their escape through the chamber
windows; and that in consequence of the wind producing
a shifting of the sand, in the winter of 1808-9, the
house, after having disappeared for more than a century,
came again to view.</p>

<p>The rector further stated that he himself remembered
two fields lost at Gwithian, and that they are now covered
with sand to the depth of ten or twelve feet, and that the
church-town would have been also lost, if the parish
<!--154.png--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
officers had not promptly resorted to an expedient, which,
simple as it may seem, has every where proved to be the
most efficacious in arresting this gigantic evil, that of planting
rushes; these stop completely the progress of sand,
and greatly facilitate the growth of other vegetation on the
surface, so as to create a thin turf. The hillocks of sand
exhibit a model in miniature of the Alps.</p>

<p>This sand is entirely calcareous, being a mass of comminuted
shells, and immense quantities are carried away for
manure, more especially in the cultivation of strong clay
lands; but no method sufficiently cheap for practice has yet
been invented for burning this shell sand into lime, as the
fine powder chokes the fuel in any kiln, and a reverberatory
furnace is much too expensive.</p>

<p>On the opposite coast of Cornwall the sand is siliceous.</p>

<p>Godrery belongs to Lord De Dunstanville, a bold promontory
distinguished by an island beyond it, and by a
dangerous reef extending far into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive’s Bay.</p>

<p>Other lands are much divided. Mr. Hoskin the present
rector, and his relations, are considerable proprietors, and
several resident farmers live on their own freeholds, Mr.
Veal, Mr. Phillips, and others.</p>

<p>Notice has been taken of a very large fig tree growing in
the churchyard; the wonder is much diminished by knowing
that this tree was planted by the late rector; but as
chalk is of all soils the most favourable to figs, it is not improbable
that calcareous sand may participate in the same
quality.</p>

<p>The parish feast is held on the nearest Sunday to the
first of November, All Saints Day.</p>

<p>This parish measures 2,249 statute acres.</p>

<p>At Bo-cuny-an, in this parish, is the dwelling of my
very kind friend Dr. Robert Heart, who married Molesworth
<!--156.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
and Hawkey; originally descended from the Hearts
of Tencreek, of Mynhyniet, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, and giveth for
his arms, Gules, on a chief Argent three human hearts
Proper.</p>

<p>Note further, that whosoever is possessed in fee of the barton
of Helland, (for Bara-ton, i. e. the Bread Town lands in
this parish,) is legal patron of the same, paying only 40<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
to the Rector Incumbent for the time being, in full satisfaction
for all the great and small tithes of the said barton,
according to an ancient pact or composition made between
the first Rector thereof and the Prior of Bodmin, who endowed
it. Which sum of 40<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per annum at the time of
the Inquisition aforesaid, was the value of the tithes of the
whole parish.</p>

<p>Note further, wherever the word barton occurs in this
history, it being Cornish British, it must be interpreted
either as the barred, bolted, or fenced towne, or as a contraction
of the word Bara-ton aforesaid, for as bara is
bread in British, so ton or tone is a town or village, a
manor, parish, tenement, or part thereof; the place where
commonly the lord of the land had a well bolted or
barred house to dwell in; or else a town or house which
was notable for keeping or dispensing freely of bread for
support of man’s life.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>The words Hel or Hale are at least the Cornish pronunciation
of the English hall, atrium, and this word was applied
to churches as well as to gentlemen’s houses in various
parts of England, as Helldon Rectory in Norfolk Halling,
Kent, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and see the 140th stanza of Mount Calvary.</p>

<p>But after all, if we may believe the parishioners, the name
<!--157.png--><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
is a contraction for Helen’s Land, the church being dedicated
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helena, the mother of Constantine.</p>

<p>In this parish lived the old family of the Giffords, who
married one of the inheritrixes of the Esses, or Vanstorts,
in the time of Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> as Gifford’s heiress was married
to Nicholls of Penrose.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker has observed, in a note on what Mr. Hals
says on the word barton, a term now almost indiscriminately
applied to all large farms, although in former
times it was probably restricted to what Mr. Hals denominates
the yoke land of a manor.</p>

<p>Barton in English is Bere-ton, as Berwick, and signifies
primarily a farm-house distinguished by the corn generally
raised, once bere, or barley; and from the house the term
has been transferred to the estate annexed. Baraton here
means the same as bara, bread or corn, bara pill the corn
harbour, bara-Llan, barton (Cornish) a cornfield, and barn
(as in English) a corn-house.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons mentions several manors in this parish, but
they do not appear ever to have possessed any importance
or curiosity, except that the manor of Penhargard belonged
to the unfortunate Chief Justice Trevilian, and that the
barton of Brades or Broads was for some time the seat of a
younger branch of the Glynns.</p>

<p>Robert Glynn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> residing there, married in 1711
Lucy Clobery, and their only son was Doctor Glynn, a
Fellow of King’s College, Cambridge, well known and distinguished
for his abilities, learning, and philanthropy,
and in some degree also for occasional eccentricities. He
obtained not merely one of the University prizes, but great
reputation by a Latin Poem on the Day of Judgment, in
the year 1757; and in illustration of other parts of his
character, having attended as a physician on the family of
some agricultural labourer near Cambridge, and restored
<!--158.png--><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
them to health, the man’s wife lamented their poverty, but
begged of the Doctor to take a tame bird in their possession,
as the only thing in their power to bestow. Doctor
Glynn accepted the present, but declared that he could not
keep his bird in a college room, and that therefore they
must keep it for him, at an allowance of half a crown a
week.</p>

<p>To be invited by Doctor Glynn to drink tea at his room
was always considered as an honour by the younger members
of the University, and the Editor remembers to have
heard that Mr. Pitt, then at the head of the government,
and just elected into a seat more flattering than any office
the crown could confer, expressed himself pleased by the
repetition of these invitations from Doctor Glynn.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The geology of this parish is similar to that of the
western part of Bodmin. It is however worthy of remark
that in the road from Bodmin to Camelford several beds of
granitic elvan are exposed to view. The first at the top of
the hill near Smith’s, resembles a coarse granitic sandstone,
and at its junction with the slate both rocks are perfectly
distinct, not having any appearance of transition, which
circumstance is in favour of its being a derivative rock. This
subject, however, requires further examination. The other
elvans are more compact and porphyritic, and contain
hornblende, resembling those of Carraton Hill, near Liskeard,
situated within the granite.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">HELSTON.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Is situate in the hundred of Kerryer, and hath upon the
east Gwendron, west Sythney and the Loopoole, south
Maugan and Gunwallo.</p>

<p>That this was a privileged place, and the voke lands of
a manor, with court leet, before the Norman Conquest, I
make no doubt, since the whole hundred of Kerryer, in
King Alfred’s days, was in chief denominated from it.
Besides this testimony, in Domesday Roll 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
1087, we read that by the name of Henliston, it was then
taxed. Moreover, Brooke, York Herald, tells us <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> in the Catalogue of Cornish Earls, that the privileges
of this town or manor were concerted into a charter,
and incorporated by Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall,
<abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> son of King Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> surnamed Cur-lyon, from
his lion-like heart, in the name of Helleston, as appeared
from the charter, which he had then in his custody, to the
seal whereof was affixed a lion rampant. It was also made
one of the four coinage towns by King Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> in his
charter to the Tinners, by the same name (See the charter
under Luxilian). As also incorporated into the Duchy of
Cornwall, by the same name 1336, when King Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
to his son the Black Prince promoted or translated the
Earldom of Cornwall into a Duchy or Dukedom.</p>

<p>Whereby this town is also confirmed to be the voke
lands of the manors or stanneries of Helston and Kerryer,
(id est, Hall, Broad Town, and Lover,) and privileged with
a Court Leet, wherein all pleas of debt and damage, between
party and party, concerning tin matters, are tried
by a jury of six men, before the Vice Warden and Steward
of the Stanneries, (under the Lord Warden thereof,) life,
land, and limb excepted. It is also privileged with a Court
<!--160.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
Leet before the tribunal of the Mayor and Aldermen, and
Quarterly Sessions of the Peace, and sending two members
to Parliament; markets weekly on Saturday; fairs on August
29, October 28, Saturday before Midlent Sunday,
Saturday before Palm Sunday, Whitsun Monday, and two
fairs before <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas à Becket’s day. Moreover, these
privileges were confirmed and enlarged by charters <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Queen Elizabeth and King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> by the name of the
Mayor and Burgesses, who consist of a Mayor (who is a
Justice of the Peace for the Borough, the year succeeding
his Mayoralty), and four Aldermen, who elect as many
Common Councilmen as make their number twelve. Their
Members of Parliament are elected by the majority of the
freemen, and returned by the Mayor, to whom the precept
on the writ for election must be thus directed, as well as
that for removing an action depending in the Leet of Helston
to a superior Court:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Majori et Burgensibus Burgi nostri de Helleston in
Comitatu Cornubiæ, salutem.”</p>

<p>Not far from this town stands the ruins of an old camp,
or intrenchment, called Castle Werre, or Wera, an old fort
or citadel to defend it from its enemies’ invasion. The arms
of which town are Argent, a castle, or house, garreted on
the top thereof, between two watch-towers, the Archangel
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael fighting with a dragon, or the devil.</p>

<p>That King Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> frequented this place for delight
or pleasure, or designed so to do, upon the death of his
uncle Richard Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans,
when the Earldom of Cornwall reverted to himself, in right
of his Crown of England, Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1272, is evident
from his granting lands by the tenure of grand sergeantry
to William de Treville, on condition of bringing a fishhook
and a boat and net, at his own proper costs and
charges, for the king’s fishing in the lake of Helston, whensoever
the King should come to Helston, and as long as he
should tarry there. See the copy of this enfeofment deed
in Sythney parish.</p>

<p><!--161.png--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
The chief inhabitants of this coinage town for tin are
Mr. Penrose, Mr. Polkinhorne, Mr. Hooker, attorney at
law, Mr. Williams, Mr. Rawe, Mr. Burges, Mr. Pinock,
and others.</p>

<p>In the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester,
into the value of Cornish Benefices, 1294, the
church of Helston is not named, but passed then under the
title of its mother or superior church, Gwendron, into which
it was consolidated, 17<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>; in Wolsey’s Inquisition,

endowed, I suppose, by the Master or Governor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John’s Hospital at Sythney, who were patrons thereof till
the 6th Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when it was dissolved, now Jago; the
incumbent Jago; and the town or parish of Helston rated

<p>In the year 1727 happened in those parts astonishing
claps of thunder and lightning, which in fine broke down
and tore in pieces the greatest part of this town’s church
and tower, and did it damage to the value of two or three
hundred pounds in repair thereof.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>This church is a Vicarage, endowed, and passeth in the
presentation with Gwendron.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, tells us that
within this town was an hospital, but gives no further account
of it; so that it is unknown to me whether it were a
spital erected for the relief of pilgrims from abroad, or for
the use of sick impoverished people within the town.
Most assured I am that near this place there was a priory
erected to the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>I have omitted some paragraphs from Hals and from
Tonkin respecting several derivations of the name “Helstone,”
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
 as all the circumstances of the place seem to point
at one so decidedly as to exclude all consideration of the
others. No doubt this one transgresses an arbitrary rule
confining the themes of all derivations to a single language;
but the instances in contradiction are so numerous
throughout all England, as to render this circumstance of
no importance.</p>

<p>The spot long used as a bowling-green is acknowledged
on all hands to have been the site of an ancient castle. It
must therefore have been the nucleus of the town; and
the marsh extending from the Loo Pool along the valley,
passes under the scarped rampart of the castle.</p>

<p>Hellas is well known to signify a marsh in the Celtic
dialect used in Cornwall, and the termination Ton, the
origin of our general word town, signified, in the Saxon,&mdash;more
especially a walled town, or fortress; Helleston is
therefore the fortress on the marsh.</p>

<p>The first charter of incorporation given to Helston, at
least from the supreme feudal chief, is said to have been by
King John. It is, however, highly probable that privileges
of guild may have been bestowed long before by the
Princes of Cornwall, vassals from the time of Athelstan.
Various other charters were granted, till, in the early part
of the reign of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> the number of corporators
became so reduced that the remainder were incapable of
performing any corporate act; a new charter was in consequence
obtained, and at the next general election the
individuals named in it returned two members; but six
persons remaining of the former party did the same: and
so strong at that period was the feeling for chartered rights,
in consequence of the conduct pursued by King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
and his successor, that a committee of the House of Commons
determined the right to remain in this fragment, incapable
of performing any other civil act. And songs were
made on the occasion, comparing these heroes with Eustace
de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pierre and his companions.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>One, if not two more returns were made in the same
manner, till the number being fallen down to two very old
men, they were induced to wave their privilege, partly, it is
said, from an apprehension entertained that the maxim of
Roman law, tres faciunt collegiam, might be effectually
urged against them.</p>

<p>A custom had grown up at Helston, from early times,
and by no means peculiar to that place, in compliance with
which the patron, a well known and definite appellation,
paid all the parochial rates; but an opinion may be
formed of their small amount at no distant period, from the
following statement. The Editor being on a Committee
of the House of Commons, to consider and report on the
poor laws soon after the conclusion of the late war, laid before
the Committee a copy of a poor rate made for a parish in
the west of England in the year 1704: it amounted to four
pounds and some few shillings, while in the current year it
exceeded six hundred pounds.</p>

<p>This practise in Helston became the ground of a petition
after the general election of 1812; and, opinions
having now changed, the matter was taken up so seriously
in the House of Commons, as to induce the passing
of a bill for disfranchising the borough. The other branch
of the legislature, however, considered the practice, although
wrong in itself, yet a delictum sine crimine, in this
particular instance, as it most clearly appeared that some
leading gentlemen, possessed of such influence as would
have enabled them to make great lucrative advantages for
themselves other ways, were benefited in so slight a degree
by these payments, as to make it quite evident that self-interest
had not been the motive of their conduct. The
<!--164.png--><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
bill did not pass into a law, and the town became regularly
assessed like other places. The well-known connection
usual in such cases had long subsisted between this town and
the neighbouring family of Godolphin.</p>

<p>In the Parliament preceding that, the Editor’s great-great-grandfather,
William Noye, afterwards Attorney-General,
represented Helston; and he himself had the
same honour in the Parliament following the Union with
Ireland. On the total change of the parliamentary constitution
in 1832, the limits of Helston were extended so as
to include a large portion of Wendron and the entire
parish of Sithney. And the whole was reduced to sending
one Member, or, according to a familiar expression, it was
placed in Schedule B.</p>

<p>On that occasion a letter was addressed to a gentleman
of the town, in return for a present of some delicacies, so
<!--165.png--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>

I should at all times have been much delighted by

<p>The old church is said by Mr. Hals to have been greatly
injured by a thunder-storm in 1727. It appears never to
have been thoroughly repaired; and in 1763, Lord Godolphin,
the patron, built a large church and a lofty tower,
nearly on the site of the former. The church is without
pillars, and capable of containing a numerous congregation;
but the whole is strongly characteristic of the bad
taste prevalent at the period when it was erected.</p>

<p>Just over the bridge leading to the westward stood the
hospital dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, and founded by a member
of the Killegrews. The spot is still marked by a large
upright stone near the bridge, bearing the sword with its crosletted
hilt, the cognizance of the military order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John.
Little, however, is known about it. Dugdale states that
at the dissolution in the 26th of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> the total
annual revenue of the house amounted to 14<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 7<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> and

<p>About the year 1805 the town received a very considerable
improvement by the removal of the Coinage Hall from
the middle of the principal street leading south-west from
<!--168.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
the middle of the town. The Editor at that time represented
Helston, and had the good fortune to assist materially
in promoting the negociation with the Duchy officers,
in consequence of his acquaintance with Mr. Sheridan, and
with others whose consent was necessary to be obtained.
The Market-house is a venerable monument of former
times; yet, if this also could be removed, the improvement
would equal that effected by the former.</p>

<p>Helston, in great measure unconnected with trade or
with a sea port, little of a thoroughfare before the turnpike
road was made, surrounded by the residences of ancient,
respectable, and wealthy families, and inhabited by gentlemen
of a similar description, has ever been celebrated for
the superior quality of its social manners, and at the same
time for an easy and familiar intercourse between all the
people in their various stations; the inferior experiencing
the truth of what all the histories of all nations have confirmed
from the earliest periods of Greece to the recent
events of our own time,</p>

<p class="unindent">These circumstances account for the continuance of old
manners and of old customs longer here than in other
places.</p>

<p>All towns appear to have adopted, on one day at least in
the year, practices similar to the Roman Saturnalia; in
most places, the lines of society having become broad and
strongly impressed, their observances descended to the
more vulgar, or rather perhaps to the vicious; and changing
their character from harmless amusements to practices of
<!--169.png--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
outrage and violence, they have been discontinued or
suppressed: but in Helston an ancient observance of
this kind, refining with the refinement of the age, still
continues in activity.</p>

<p>The origins of all these customs are obscured or totally
lost in their remote antiquity. That of Helston corresponded,
however, precisely with its name&mdash;“a foray,” locally
corrupted into furray; the young people rushed out of the
town into the country early on the eighth of May, when,
entering all houses without leave or ceremony, they appeared
to seize whatever they wanted, and from the real
nature of the transactions, whatever they wanted was sure
of being found; and ultimately they returned to the town
in triumph, dancing and decorated with flowers, where the
scenes of the morning were, in some degree, repeated. All
these practices, however, are less and less persevered in
from year to year, so that the whole is rapidly tending
towards the single entertainment of a ball; and if the ladies
had succeeded in a classical fancy, which, some how or other,
got possession of their minds, the very memory of this
festival would have been lost.</p>

<p>Not intimately acquainted, one may presume, with the
true history of the patroness they had selected to sanction
their gaieties, the goddess Flora was made to preside over
a foray, instituted, as some assert, before the Norman conquest,
and in commemoration of a victory obtained over
the Saxons, who had landed at a cove still called Perthsasnac;
but the utter absurdity of the substitution, and
the popularity given to the word <span class="muchsmaller">FORAY</span> by Sir Walter
Scott’s Poems, have restored the ancient and true appellation.</p>

<p>Causes similar to those which have retained the foray,
have also kept up the practice of bowling; so that in
Helston alone can one now see the principal gentlemen of
the town assembled on the bowling-green, enjoying at once
exercise, fresh air, and agreeable intercourse, free from any
<!--170.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
spirit of gambling and from the slightest indulgence of a
habit more common and less excusable.</p>

<p>The word faddy is used to express the dance, the air, or
both, used in celebrating the foray; the origin of this term
is quite unknown.</p>

<p>The air is preserved by Edward Jones in his Musical
and Poetical Relics of the Welsh Bards. He has also
printed some lines which were sung by the dancers; they
are, however, so entirely devoid of sense, or even of antiquity,
that I shall not transcribe them.</p>

<p>The air is supposed to be a remnant of British music;
one very like it, if not identically the same, has been found
in Ireland, and according to report in Scotland. It may
therefore be justly esteemed a curiosity.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><a name="Hilary" id="Hilary"></a><abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> HILARY.</h3>

<p class="p2">Mr. Hals begins his account of this parish with a long
history of the patron saint, including all the controversies
or disputed points of doctrine in which he was engaged;
all this, extending through many pages, is omitted.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary was born at Poictiers, in France, about the
end of the third or the beginning of the fourth century.</p>

<p>He was descended from an illustrious family, and received
an education suited to his station in life, by which
he was initiated into all the secular learning of those times;
but finding the Pagan mythology utterly absurd, and the
prevalent system of philosophy quite unsatisfactory, he examined
the Christian writings, and became a convert. He
seems never to have adopted the brutalizing austerities so
prevalent in those ages, but to have employed his talents,
his acquired eloquence, and his learning, against the Arians
and in defence of the Nicene creed. Several of his works
are extant, and have gone through many editions. The
whole were printed by the Benedictine Monks of Paris,
“<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hilarii Opera omnia per Monachos Benedictinos
edita; Gr. et Lat. Parisiis</span>, 1693, Fol.” Erasmus published
the works of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary in 1544, and says in his Preface,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quicquid ingenio, quicquid eloquentia, quicquid sacrarum
literarum cognitione posset;”</span> and his contemporary,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome, says of him, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hilarius, meorum Confessor
temporum, et Episcopus, duodecim Quintiliani libros et
titulo imitatus est et numero;”</span> referring to his twelve
books on the Trinity.</p>

<p>In the judgment of modern critics his style at least is
not thought worthy of all the praise bestowed on it by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Jerome; for, although it is stated to be lofty and noble, and
moreover beautified with rhetorical ornaments and figures,
yet it is too much studied and lengthened in many periods,
so as to be obscure and even unintelligible.</p>

<p><!--172.png--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
The following passage on singleness of heart, has been
cited by various authors.</p>

<p>“Christ teaches that only those who become again, as it
were, little children, and by the simplicity of that age cut
off the inordinate affections of vice, can enter into the
kingdom of heaven. Those follow and obey their father,
love their mother, are strangers to covetousness, ill-will,
hatred, arrogance, lying, and are inclined easily to believe
what they hear. This disposition of affection opens the
way to heaven. We must therefore return to the simplicity
of little children, in which we shall bear some resemblance
to our Lord’s humility.” From his commentary
on the Gospel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Matthew.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, previous to his conversion, had married, and
his family consisted of one daughter; he immediately
separated himself from them; his wife retired into a religious
society. And after the saint had been consecrated
Bishop of Poictiers in the year 355, he learned with the
utmost horror and affright that his daughter was about to
take on herself the unholy bonds of matrimony. His
prompt and impassioned remonstrances conveyed in a letter
which is printed among his works, conjuring her by the
God of heaven not to act so unworthy a part, were successful;
the marriage was broken off, and he had the gratification
of seeing his daughter, a spouse of Christ, expire
not long after at his feet.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary composed a treatise which might in ordinary
times have conciliated him to every sect then in existence.
He there maintained that errors on speculative points of
abstruse doctrine, were more sinful in the sight of God than
any conduct the most atrocious; but controversy ran so
high, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary had taken a part so violent against
the Arians, that even this merit could not save him from
banishment, when that equally poised division of the
church obtained some temporary preponderance in a
synod, or succeeded in acquiring to their party the temporal
chief; who, without using the form of words, practically
<!--173.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
evinced that he was “over all persons and over all
causes, ecclesiastical as well as civil, within those his dominions
supreme.”</p>

<p>The saint, however, died at Poictiers in the year 368.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine relates many miracles wrought at his tomb;
but the relics are said to have been removed to the Abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Denis, near Paris; and his festival is kept on the
14th of January, although it is not certain either that he
died, or that his relics were translated on that particular
day.</p>

As for the name Hilary, it is derived from the tutelar
guardian and patron of this church, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, Bishop
of Poictiers in Gaul, the maul and hammer against the
Arians, whose fame is eternized in the Roman agonals and
festivals, though his memory and day is not celebrated as a
martyr, but as one of the principal confessors of the Roman
church; that is to say, one of those that suffered great persecution
for the name and Gospel of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Treveneage, in this parish, was formerly the lands of
Sir Thomas Arundell, of Tolverne, Knight, who sold this

of Exeter; from whose heirs it came by purchase to Sir

<p>In Domesday Roll, 20th William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, this place
was taxed by the name of Tremarastoll; that is to say, the
cell, chapel, or hole market-town; situate in a remote
corner, vallum, or pit, upon the seashore of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s
Mount. At which time, no doubt, the Abbat or Prior of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount (as they were afterwards till 26th
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when that Abbey was dissolved), were lords
and high lords thereof; when it was privileged with the
jurisdiction of a court leet; as afterwards, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
with sending two of its members to sit in the Commons’
House of Parliament. But, as appears from the Parliament
Rolls in the Tower of London, after the dissolution of the
Abbey or Priory aforesaid, this town neglected to send its
Members, “for that it could not conveniently pay its burgesses
their daily wages, propter paupertatem,” which are
the words of the record.(<a name="fnb" id="fnb"></a><a href="#FNb"><span class="decoration">b</span></a>) It is also privileged with a fair,
or mart, on July 11th, November 30th, Good Friday, and
Palm Monday; and a market weekly on Saturdays.</p>

And as a further mark of its ancient grandeur, I take it
still to be an incorporate mayor or portreeve town; but
more sure I am, that, as some other petty corporations’
names in Cornwall are adjectives merged or fallen in or
upon the parishes wherein they are situate, as Camelford,
Mitchell, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> this town is a noun substantive, and
stands charged by itself in the Exchequer to the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per

Maraszeyan, 76<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 12<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 6<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>In the beginning of the reign of King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> (1514)
when war had been proclaimed against the French King, a
fleet of French men of war, consisting of thirty sail, with
some marine regiments of soldiers therein, coasting in our
British Channel, at length came into this Mount’s Bay, and
there dropped anchor; when soon after they landed a considerable
number, or quantity, of seamen and soldiers, and
marched in hostile manner towards this town. Which the
inhabitants observing, they forsook their houses, and fled
to the hill country; whereby the Frenchmen became
peaceably possessed thereof, and plundered the same for
some days, till they understood that John Carminow, of
Fentongollan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was coming or marching towards them,
with his posse comitatus, to give them battle; when instantly
they set the town on fire, and the houses on the contiguous
part of the country, and burnt the same totally to the
ground, to the great loss and damage of the inhabitants,
and forthwith fled to their ships for safety and protection;
and thereupon their ships hoisted anchors and put forth to
sea again. Where they had not long been till Sir Anthony
Oughthred, King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>’s Admiral at sea, with a
squadron of thirty men of war, met and gave them battle,
to their great loss of men and some ships of war, whilst the
rest of their fleet ran away, and fled into the haven of
Brest for safety and protection.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE HISTORY OF <abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> MICHAEL<sup>’</sup>S MOUNT.&mdash;PART <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span></p>

<p>So called, for that our ancestors, the Britons, apprehended
the appearance of the Archangel <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael,
about the year of our Lord 495, was in this place, though
the Italians say it was upon Mount Garganus, in their
country, and the Frenchmen tell us that it was upon
their Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, in Normandy; such difference
amongst writers is about it; and verily this matter of fact
is worth contending for, since the etymology of Michael
is “sicut Deus,” i. e. as God, as I have shewn elsewhere
under other churches to him dedicated. It appears from
the history of the church of Landaff, as Mr. Camden hath
observed, that this mount was called Dinsill, and Dinsull,
but what those words should signify he could not tell.(<a name="fnc" id="fnc"></a><a href="#FNc"><span class="decoration">c</span></a>)</p>

<p>Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 154, tells us,
that beside those religious appellations that were given to
it, it was called in British, Cara cowz in clouz, which
he interprets as the Grey rock in the flood, a corruption
of Carra clo gris en an coos; i. e. rock-clo-grey in the
wood.(<a name="fnd" id="fnd"></a><a href="#FNd"><span class="decoration">d</span></a>) Of this place Mr. Carew, and Mr. Camden that
trode in his steps, tells us, that it was the Ocrinum, Οκρινυμ,
or Ocrinium of Ptolomy and Atticus, the Greek geographers;
and yet Camden, in another place, fixes that name
on the Lizard Point.</p>

<p>This Mount is comparatively a pyramidal crag, containing
about seven acres of land in compass; at the foot
whereof, towards the land, is a level piece of ground covered
with grass, where there is a wharf, or key, for landing
goods and merchandize from the sea; also some dwelling-houses
and fish-cellars, and a cemetery for burying the
dead. To this Mount the sea daily makes its flux and reflux,
and affords safe riding and anchorage to boats, barks,
and barges, with some winds. And that which tends more
to the convenience and security of this place, that at low
water it is all part of the insular continent of Britain, and
<!--177.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
at full sea an island of itself. To which purpose thus speaks
Mr. Carew out of the Cornish Wonder Gatherer:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Who knows not Migell’s Mount and chair,</div>
  <div class="i2">The pilgrim’s holy vaunt;</div>
  <div class="i0">Both land and island twice a day,</div>
  <div class="i2">Both fort and port of haunt.</div>
</div>

<p>For to this Mount and chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael devout
Christians in former ages came as pilgrims from the
furthest part of this land, with rich offerings and oblations
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s altar, Abbat, or Prior; also tradition tells
us that in former ages this mount was parcel of the solid
lands of this parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, and severed or disjointed
from it by some earthquake, terrestrial concussion, or inundation
of the sea; and to prove this, it is alleged that in
the Mount’s Bay, after some great tempests, the bodies and
roots of oak-trees have been discovered in the sand, broken
up by the surges of the sea; the like observation is made
by Camden and Lhuyd on the sea shores of Pembrokeshire,
and I myself, and many others, in the moors of Calestock
Veor, Calestock Rule, Rheese, and Polgoda in Peransand,
have seen and found, deep under ground, far from the sea,
in the fens and turf lands, the bodies and roots of several
oak trees, the hearts whereof were firm and solid. But
whether those seas were formerly dry land, and the fens
aforesaid the places where these trees grew (none in those
parts being now to be seen there), let others resolve; or
rather whether they are not subterraneous trees, that grew
or are generated there, as some philosophers hold and teach,
under the earth.</p>

<p>From the foot of Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael you ascend the
hill or rock through a narrow, crooked, craggy path to the
outer portal or gate; a considerable height on the one side,
by the way in the rock, is a small spring of water, that falls
into pits made in the stones to lodge the same, for the
lower or bottom inhabitants’ use; which water never intermits
its currrent. Above the second gate there is another
<!--178.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
spring of water issuing out of the rocks, that makes
a pretty confluence for six or seven winter months, and
then intermits, which renders the portage of it upwards
much the easier for the inhabitants’ use in that season. After
you pass through this second gate, betwixt a winding and
crooked path, artificially cut in the rocks on the north side
thereof, and follow the same, you arrive to the top of this
Mount, where towards the north-west is a kind of level
plain, about four or six land-yards, which gives a full prospect
of the Mount’s Bay, the British Ocean, Penzance
town, Newlyn, Moushole, Gulvall, Maddarn, Paul, and
other parishes, over a downright precipice of rocks towards
the sea, at least twenty fathoms high. From this little
square or plain, there is an artificial kind of ascent also
going towards the east, which offers you a full sight of the
outer walls of the castle, and brings you to Porth-Horne,
(i. e. the Iron Gate) part of which is yet to be seen. This
little fortress comprehendeth sufficient rooms and lodgings
for the captain or governor and his soldiers to reside in, to
which adjoining are several other houses or cells, heretofore
pertaining to the monks that dwelt here; all admirable
for their strength, buildings, and contrivance, on the
top of a rock naturally fortified: so that a small number of
soldiers, having provision and ammunition, might defend
themselves against the greatest armies in former ages,
though I confess now, since the art of war is grown to
greater perfection in mischief and destruction, a few cannon
or bombs from the opposite hills would soon shatter it to
pieces.</p>

<p>On this Mount, King Edward the Confessor, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr>
1044, founded and endowed an Abbey or Priory of Benedictine
Monks, that is to say Augustines reformed, with a
little chapel yet standing, and dedicated the same to the
Archangel <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, part whereof is now converted to a
dwelling house, in which there is yet to be seen cut in
stone three or four coats of arms, one of which was, as I
remember, a Chevron between three fleurs-de-lis.</p>

<p><!--179.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
That it had at that time considerable revenues belonging
to it I make no question, since in the Domesday
Book, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, Lan-migell was then taxed,
that is to say Michael’s church or Temple, as aforesaid.
But that which renders this place most famous is the present
church or chapel and tower, cemetery, and cells cut
in the rocks for hermetical monks of the order aforesaid;
built and further endowed by William Earl of Morton and
Cornwall, yet extant and kept in good repair, with pews;
to whose father, Robert Earl of Morton, King William
the Conqueror had given the lands of many rebels in those
parts, and in particular this Mount, with its appurtenances,
(dedicated as aforesaid) and created him Earl of Cornwall,
whose successors held the same by tenure of Knight Service
till <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Of which sort of tenures there
were lately extant, in the hundred of Penwith, thirteen
knight’s fees.&mdash;Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 39. And in
other hundreds three hundred more in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Upon the tower of this church or chapel, for it is bigger
than many other Cornish parish churches, is that celebrated
place called Kader Migell, i. e. Michael’s Chair, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a
kind of seat artificially made or cut in the stones on the
top of its tower, very dangerous in the access and tremendous
to behold.</p>

<p>Contrary to this description, Mr. Carew, in his Survey
of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 154, tells us that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Chair is a
bad seat, in a craggy place without the castle, dangerous
for the access and therefore holy for the adventure; so that
I conceive he had this report by hearsay, not ocular demonstration.
In this chapel are yet to be seen the tombstones
of several persons there interred, in the rocks, (with
a small quantity of earth, though without the chapel there
is a bank of earth, brought there by art for burying the
dead,) but the inscriptions on those tombstones are so
obliterated with dust and time, that I had not leisure much
to examine them. The roof and timber of this temple is
yet so firm and uniformly kept in repair, that no decay,
<!--180.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
moth, or spider’s web are to be seen in the roof thereof,
which gives occasion to a conjecture that the same was all
built of Irish oak, which drives that poisonous creature
the spider from it. Certes, this fabrick is not only an evident
proof of the great skill which former ages, in William
the Conqueror’s days, had in the art of architecture, but
that many other such of much later erection can hardly
equal the same, though it has stood firm above six hundred
years.</p>

<p>This abbey or priory of Benedictine Monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael,
after the donation thereof by the Conqueror to his
nephew Robert Earl of Morton aforesaid, was by him annexed
and made subject for religious matters to the Abbey
of Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael in Normandy, under which circumstance
it stood till the French wars, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> 1414,
when the Statute, made 1380, in the reign of King
Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was put in force, for suppressing alien priories
(who secretly communicated the state affairs to foreigners).
King Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> or <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> then gave this Alien Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael to Sion Abbey in Middlesex, under which rule
and jurisdiction it remained till 26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, 1533,
when it was dissolved; when, I take it, it passed in value
with Sion, since the Monasticon Anglicanum does not
mention it separate.</p>

<p>The Mount is now in possession of Sir John Saintaubyn,
(formerly Bassett) who for melancholy retirement dwelleth
here. It is still privileged with royalties over the Mount’s
Bay, as far north as Long Bridge in the manor of Lanesely,
with wrecks, anchorage of ships, quayage or wharfage
of goods, and with keeping annual fairs on the sea shore near
it, September 29, Monday after Midlent Sunday. Round
this Mount, for two leagues space, is an indifferent safe
road for anchorage of ships, when the wind is proper for
it; and here, as Froissart saith, landed Sir Robert Knollys,
a valiant commander of the Black Prince’s in the French
wars <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (who drew the traitor Sir Perducas
D’Albert from the French to the English army, to
<!--181.png--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
which afterwards he returned again most perfidiously,)
where he had been highly instrumental in taking the forts
of Froyns, Roach, Vandower, Ville Franck, and other
places for the English; from hence he went to London by
land, was graciously received and plentifully rewarded for
his good services by King Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">PART <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p>This Mount, from the time of King Edward the Confessor
to the middle of the reign of King Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> for
the space of 150 years, was a sacred nursery of religion;
but then, notwithstanding the sanctity thereof, and the
guardianship of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, it was seized by one Henry
de la Pomeray, Lord of Berry-Pomeray in Devon, and
Tregony Pomeray in this county, being distasted at the government
of King Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> as many others were, by
reason of the Pope’s request he engaged in the Holy War,
and forsook his kingdom, leaving for his vicegerent William
Longchamp, a Norman Bishop of Ely; who had extorted
great sums of money from the people in his absence,
without a Parliament; and moreover so insulted over the
nobility and gentry of this kingdom in his office, that he
discontented the greatest part of them; and to countenance
his grandeur he seldom rode abroad with less than a thousand
attendants. Those and others his exorbitances gave occasion
to John Earl of Cornwall and others to fall into treasonable
practices, and of this number it seems this Sir Pomeray
was one, who not only informed the King beyond the seas
of these topping, magisterial, and illegal practices of Longchamp
at home, but that by reason thereof King Philip of
France, in those distractions, took occasion with a great
army of soldiers to invade Normandy, and had taken the
town of Guisors and many other places by force and arms,
and would reduce the whole province in short while (if not
resisted) to his dominion. Whereupon the King, in answer,
by his letters patent, deposed Longchamp from his
<!--182.png--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
authority, and placed the Archbishop of Rouen in his place,
when soon after Longchamp, in women’s apparel, made
his escape into his own country, but was detected and
shrewdly beaten with rods before his departure out of
England, by the women there.</p>

<p>Longchamp, as tradition saith, having notice that de la
Pomeray was in confederacy with Earl John, who under
pretence of opposing his vice-government, designed the
usurpation of King Richard’s Crown, (though he had told
him that in case his brother should die, before he returned
into his kingdom, without issue, that the right of succession
was in Arthur Duke of Britany, his elder brother’s
son, not him,) sent a sergeant at arms to the castle of Berry
Pomeray in Devon, where he then resided, in order to arrest
and take him into custody, which he no sooner did
but Pomeray stabbed him to the heart, of which wound he
instantly died. Upon which tragical accident the murderer
fled into Cornwall, where he had great possessions
in lands, and besides twelve lordships held by the tenure of
knight service. And there cast himself upon his amicus,
John Earl of that province, who as tradition saith secretly
supplied him with divers men at arms to secure his person
against his enemy the Viceroy, which accordingly they did
till Longchamp was displaced.</p>

<p>Afterwards, notice being given that King Richard was
taken prisoner coming from the Holy War, 1194, by Leopold,
Archduke of Austria in Germany, and cast into his
prison called Trivalis, in which no man before was known
to be put that escaped with life, this news prompted Pomeray
from the sin of murder to that of rebellion; resolving
to reduce this Mount of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael to Earl John’s dominion,
and to place himself therein for better safety. In
order to which he found out this expedient, to go with his
guard of armed men that daily attended him in disguise to
that place, under pretence of visiting a sister that he had
amongst the religious people there;(<a name="fne" id="fne"></a><a href="#FNe"><span class="decoration">e</span></a>) who upon discovering
who he was, and the occasion of his coming, had the gates
<!--183.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
opened, where he entered with his followers, who soon
after discovered under their clothes their weapons of war,
and declared their design was for reducing the Mount to
the dominion and use of John Earl of Cornwall, and that
if any person opposed them therein, they would revenge it
upon him to the loss of their lives; whereupon, he commanded
the Prior and his monks to deliver him the keys
of the gates, and possession of the houses thereof for common
uses, though therein they much discommoded the
monks with their soldiers. Nevertheless, for fear of greater
damage, they patiently submitted to his pleasure; who
thereupon with his soldiers fortified the place, and so made
it comparatively impregnable, and so there lived in great
pomp and triumph for some time, not expecting ever to
hear that King Richard was in the land of the living, or
delivered from prison, it being for some time reported he
was dead. But, alas! many times common fame is a common
liar, and all men are apt to believe such matters and
things as they would willingly have come to pass, or stand
well affected to.</p>

<p>But contrary to the expectation of Pomeray and his
confederates, King Richard, after fifteen months’ durance
in prison, was ransomed for one hundred thousand pounds,
and returned safe to London; when he found his brother
John formidable, and making way to his crown, having
got possession of the castles of Lancaster, Marlborough,
Nottingham, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, and other fortresses,
into which he had placed governors and soldiers. Whereupon,
in order to reduce those places, King Richard raised
a considerable army; at the news whereof Earl John fled
into France, and was by his brother deprived of all his
possessions in England: notwithstanding which, the garrisons
aforesaid stood firm to Earl John’s interest, till at the
siege of Vernoil in Normandy, he fled from the French
army to that of his brother, threw down his arms and submitted
to his mercy; whereupon he was restored to all
his lands and dignities, both in Normandy and England.
<!--184.png--><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
But notwithstanding this concord and agreement between
King Richard and his brother John, the castles aforesaid
stood out, and would not surrender for some time after, especially
this Mount, which Pomeray commanded. Whereupon
King Richard commanded Richard Revell, then
sheriff of Cornwall, with his posse comitatus, to assist Hubert
Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, Chief Justice and
Lord Chancellor of England, whom he had sent as his
general into Cornwall to besiege <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, and
reduce Pomeray to his duty and allegiance; which army of
men, and bands of soldiers, no sooner approached the
same (as Hoveden saith) and gave him summons, but the
sight of the numerous army he was to contend with so
affrighted Pomeray and his confederates, that forthwith,
without resistance, he surrendered the garrison on mercy
to the said Walter, for the use of King Richard, 1194, at
the consideration of which and his other facts, through
trouble of mind he soon after died, as despairing of pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, tells us, by report
of some of his posterity, that he made his will and
bequeathed part of his lands to the monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s
Mount, others to the Knights of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of Jerusalem, to
pray for his soul; the remainder descended to his heir
(which we have no reason to doubt of, since Henry de la
Pomeray, one of his posterity, 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> at Tregony,
held twelve knights’ fees of land in Cornwall, id. Mr.
Carew); having so done, he caused himself to be blooded
to death, to make his bequests good and valid in law; after
his death King Richard restored the prior and his monks
to the full possession of their cells, revenues, and chapel;
and in de la Pomeray’s fort, he placed a small garrison of
soldiers, to defend the same against sudden invasion of enemies;
and in this condition <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount remained
from the year 1196 to the year 1471, 275 years, manned
out with carnal and spiritual soldiers.(<a name="fnf" id="fnf"></a><a href="#FNf"><span class="decoration">f</span></a>)</p>

<p>Richard de Vere, the eleventh Earl of Oxford, married
Alice, one of the daughters and coheirs of Sir Richard
Sergeaulx, knight, Lord of Collquite and Killygarth,
widow of Guy Seyntaubyn, Sheriff of Cornwall 22
Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 1399; but she passed her lands from her
son by her first husband, to her second husband the Earl
of Oxford, who had issue by her John de Vere, the 12th
Earl of Oxford, who married Elizabeth, daughter of
Sir John Howard Knight; the which John, the 12th
Earl, was the chief of those barons that opposed the precedence
in parliament of the Lords Spiritual, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>
the which Parliament roll in the Tower of London, is thus
endorsed:</p>

<p><span class="sc">Memorandum.</span>&mdash;The Lords Spiritual alleged that, forasmuch
as they were spiritual Barons, they ought to have
the right of precedence of the Lords Temporal, for it was
well known how far things spiritual exceeded carnal or
temporal. To which this Earl of Oxford replied on behalf
of the Lords Temporal, that whatsoever right or privilege
they had or could challenge, [see Brooke on Oxford, Earl,]
it came from them and their ancestors, and their almsdeeds,
who had been the worthy founders and benefactors
of the Lords Spiritual; and further said it was an unseemly
thing for masters to be inferior to their servants, who were
descended of regal, honourable, and noble families, which
most of the Spiritual Barons were not; which matter being
fully understood, and indifferently heard, the Lords Temporal,
by means of the logic and rhetoric of this Earl, had
then the precedence of place in Parliament given them.
But, alas! this bold demand, question, and argument of
his, at that time, was a project rather pitied than admired
by his best friends, for though it succeeded well in one Parliament,
it got him many enemies in another. So that in
the Parliament, held <abbr title="second">2d.</abbr> November, 1462, tempore Edward
<!--186.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, this Earl, and his son Aubrey, were attainted of treason
against that King, on the behalf of Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, and both
beheaded without trial or answer.&mdash;(Baker’s Chronicle,
page 204.)</p>

<p>Whereupon John, his second son, succeeded, and was the
13th Earl of Oxford, who married Margaret daughter of
Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, who, as his father had
done before, adhered to the interest of King Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>,
against Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, and was at the battle of Barnet
Heath 1471, and had, with the Marquess Montacute, the
command of the right wing of King Henry’s horse, under
Richard Earl of Warwick, general of his army; and when
in the battle, it appeared the vanward of King Henry’s
horse had somewhat worsted King Edward’s party, by the
valour of the Earl of Oxford, the news presently fled to
London that Warwick had obtained the victory; but, alas!
Fama est mendax; for immediately after a strange misfortune
befel the Earl of Oxford and his men in the latter
part of this encounter. They having a star with streams on
their liveries, as King Edward’s soldiers had the sun, the
General Warwick’s men, by reason of a great mist, (raised
as was thought by the magic art of Friar Bungey) mistaking
the badges, shot at the Earl of Oxford’s men, which
were of their own party, to their great hurt and destruction;
whereupon the Earl, seeing how matters went, cried
out treason, and forthwith fled with 800 men, whose departure
gave King Edward opportunity to obtain a total
victory over his enemies.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Duke of Somerset and this Earl of Oxford
fled to Jasper Earl of Pembroke, in Wales, for safety
and protection; from whence Oxford, and a convenient
number of men of arms, shipped themselves from Milfordhaven,
and with a fair wind sailed down <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s
Channel, turned the Land’s End, and came safely at anchor
in this Mount’s Bay. Where, as soon as the Earl
and his men had disguised themselves in pilgrims’ and
friars’ apparel, under which all had lodged a small sword
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
and a dagger, they went on shore, pretending that they
were pilgrims that had come a long pilgrimage from the
remotest part of this kingdom, to perform the penance imposed
upon them by their father confessors, and to perform
their vows, make orisons and oblations to the altar of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, who presided there; upon which pious pretext
the monks and inhabitants opened their gates and let
them into the castle, where they were no sooner entered,
but, as de la Pomeray had done before, they shewed their
weapons, discovered their impious fraud, and made known
who they were, and their designs to kill all persons that
made resistance or opposed King Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> for whom the
Earl of Oxford was come to take possession of this Mount,
and would keep it to his use; whereupon, the monks and
the small garrison were necessitated to comply with their
demands, and yield them a quiet possession thereof; which
forthwith the Earl put in better repair, and by the interest
of King Henry and the Earl’s friends and relations in those
parts, his grandmother as aforesaid being Sir Guy <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Aubyn’s widow and Sergeaulx’s coheir, he soon got ammunition,
provision, and soldiers sufficient for their defence.</p>

<p>As soon as King Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> heard of the surprise of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount by the Earl of Oxford, he issued
forth his proclamation, proclaiming him and all his adherents
traitors, and then consulted how to regain both to
his obedience; and in order thereto he forthwith sent to
Sir John Arundell of Trerice, Knight, then Sheriff of
Cornwall, to reduce and besiege the same by his posse
comitatus; which gentleman, pursuant to his orders, and by
virtue of his office, soon rose a considerable army of men
and soldiers within his bailiwick, and marched with them
towards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, where being arrived he sent
a trumpeter to the Earl with a summons of surrender of
that garrison to him for King Edward upon mercy; especially
for that in so doing, in all probability, he would prevent
the effusion of much Christian blood.</p>

<p>To this summons of the trumpeter the Earl sent a flat
<!--188.png--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
denial; saying further, that rather than he would yield the
fort on those terms, himself and those with him were all
resolved to lose their lives in defence thereof. Whereupon
the Sheriff commanded his soldiers, being very numerous
on all parts, to storm the Mount, and reduce it by force;
but, alas! maugre all their attempts (of this kind) the
besieged so well defended every part of this rocky mountain
that in all places the Sheriff’s men were repulsed with some
loss; and the besieged issued forth from the outer gate and
pursued them with such violence, that the said Sir John
Arundell and some others were slain upon the sands at the
foot of the Mount, to the great discouragement of the new-raised
soldiers, who quickly departed thence, having lost
their leader; leaving the besieged in better heart than they
found them, as much elevated at their good success as
themselves were dismayed at their bad fortune. This Sir
John Arundell, as Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall,
tells us, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 119, had long before been told by some fortune-teller
that he should be slain in the sands; wherefore, to
avoid that destiny, he removed from Efford, near Stratton
on the sands, where he dwelt, to Trerice, far off from the
sea-sands, yet by this misfortune fulfilled the prediction in
another place.</p>

<p>King Edward, upon news of this tragical accident, forthwith
ordered letters patent to be drawn for making John
Fortescue, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall, in the place of Sir
John Arundell, slain as aforesaid; who being accordingly
sworn in that office, received the same commands, and
took the same measures for reducing the Mount as the
former Sheriff had done, by summons and assault, but was
always, and in all places, repulsed with dishonour and loss,
the same being as stoutly defended within as it was assaulted
without; the fort thus appearing invincible. All which circumstances
being transmitted to King Edward by Mr.
Fortescue, the Sheriff, the King, for prevention of further
bloodshed, ordered him to have a parley with the said Earl
of Oxford, and know what his designs and expectations
<!--189.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
were; who thereupon sent a messenger to him for that
purpose; from whom he received this resolute and desperate
answer,&mdash;that, if the King would pardon the offences
of him and his adherents, and grant them their lives, liberties,
and estates, that then he would yield up the fort to
his use; otherwise they would fight it out to the last man.
Which answer being sent up to the King, he granted their
request; and forthwith ordered a proclamation of free
pardon to be made unto them, under the broad seal of
England; which, with all convenient speed was sent down,
and by Mr. Sheriff Fortescue delivered to the Earl, to the
great quiet and content of all parties. Whereupon the
fort was yielded to him for the King’s use; and the Earl
of Oxford was soon after sent prisoner to the castle of
Hamms, in Normandy, where he was continued a prisoner
till the first year of King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1485, with whom he
came into England, and led the vanward of his army at Bosworth
Field against King Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> where he was slain.
After the death of this Earl’s first wife, he married Elizabeth,
daughter of Sir Richard Scrope, Knight, widow of
William Lord Beaumont, by whom he had no issue; so
that, he dying the 4th Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> left John, the son of
George Vere his brother, his heir and successor, and
the fourteenth Earl of Oxford, who gave for his arms,
Gules, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">escartellé de Or, le premier brisé d’un molette de
Argent</span>.</p>

<p>King Edward attributed this ineffectual long siege of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Mount either to the cowardice or disloyalty of
the Sheriffs and country people of Cornwall; but there
was no just cause for this conjecture, since Sir John Arundell
and several of his men lost their lives about it: at
other times, he would say the inhabitants were more affected
to the house of Lancaster than that of York; whereupon,
when the said Mr. Fortescue went out of his office after
four years’ service, he made his brother Richard Duke of
Gloucester Sheriff of Cornwall during life; for that he was
often heard to say he looked upon Cornwall only as the
<!--190.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
back-door of rebellion; so that those several persons set
down in the catalogue of Sheriffs of Cornwall after Fortescue,
were not absolute Sheriffs, but Deputies under the
said Duke, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Daubeny, Carnesew, Willoughby, Nanfon,
Grenvill, Fullford, Treffry, Terrill, and Houghton, who
stiled themselves Vicecomes, and their under Sheriffs Sub-Vicecomes.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">PART <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></p>

<p>About the year of our Lord 1496, when James <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
King of Scotland, upon a truce with King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> of
England, had expulsed from Scotland that counterfeit sham
Prince, Perkin Warbeck (the pretended Richard of
Shrewsbury, youngest son of King Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> who had
before been murdered in the Tower), to whom he had
given in marriage his near kinswoman the Lady Katherine
Gordon; he, together with his wife and family, sailed from
thence over into Ireland, to seek friendship there of the
rebels and all others well affected to the House of York;
where being arrived, and fortune favouring him according
to his expectation, news was brought him there that the
Cornish rebels were ready to renew their former hostility,
and venture their lives in battle upon the title of the house
of York against that of Lancaster, had they a valiant and
able General to lead them, notwithstanding Flammock and
his confederates under the same engagement were defeated
and executed in 1495.</p>

<p>These tidings were very acceptable to Perkin; who
thereupon consulted his privy councillors, Hearn, Astley,
and Skelton, a mercer, a tailor, and a scrivener, all bankrupts;
these all agree, nemine contradicente, that his four
ships of war should forthwith be rigged and manned for an
expedition into Cornwall; which accordingly being prepared,
himself with his lady, and 120 soldiers, embarked
thereon, and being favoured with a fair wind, took his
leave of his Irish friends, and in the month of September,
1499, 15th Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> (Carew’s Survey of Cornwall,
<!--191.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 98,) came safely to anchor in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount’s
Bay; where soon after he landed, and went up to the
Mount, and made himself known to the monks and other
inhabitants, publishing himself to be the true and real
Richard of Shrewsbury aforesaid, the true heir of the House
of York; which the monks, greatly affected to that title,
were so very ready to believe, that they yielded the Mount
and garrison without resistance into his hands; who presently
renewed the old fortifications, and put the same into
a better posture of defence.</p>

<p>Which having done, himself with a band of soldiers
marched from thence to Bodmin (where the rendezvous of
Flammock’s rebels in those parts formerly was,) in which
place, by false words and promises, he so prevailed with the
discontented rebels of that town and contiguous country,
that he soon got together, without money or reward, at
least three thousand men that could bear arms; these he
divided into companies, and bands, and regiments, under
Captains, Majors, and Colonels expert in war to instruct
them in military discipline, till at length his army grew to
six thousand well-armed soldiers. Whereupon King Henry
<abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> having notice of Perkin’s landing and formidableness
in these parts, ordered Sir Peter Edgecombe, Knight,
then Sheriff of Cornwall (whose father, Sir Richard Edgecombe,
Knight, was one of that King’s Privy Councillors,
and had comparatively been raised to his great estate by
his boon and favour), that he should forthwith, by virtue
of his office, raise the country, and give battle to this counterfeit
Richard of Shrewsbury and his confederate rebels.
Whereupon, the Sheriff did as he was commanded, and
raised an army of twenty thousand men, as tradition saith,
and led them towards Bodmin; but when they approached
near, and saw Perkin entrenched at Castle Keynock, on the
east hill of Bodmin Downs, with the body of his army,
and divers troops of horse and bands of foot placed towards
Lanhydrock and the roads from Cardenham, in
order to resist and oppose the Sheriff, his men resolved to
<!--192.png--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
march no further, but to return from whence they came
without giving battle. Which accordingly they did (notwithstanding
the Sheriff’s threats and commands to the
contrary), in great terror and confusion and astonishment;
but whether this fear proceeded from the cowardice of the
Sheriff and his men, or their disaffection to the Lancastrian
dominion of King Henry, is uncertain, for the like fact
was committed two years before by the posse comitatus of
John Basset, of Tehidy, then Sheriff, which he had raised to
suppress Flammock’s rebellion.</p>

<p>Upon news of this flight and disbanding of the Sheriff’s
men, Perkin was saluted by his soldiers and confederates
as King of England: and soon after, not only in his camp,
but in divers places of Bodmin town, was proclaimed by
a trumpeter and others, King of England and France, and
Lord of Ireland, with great shouts and acclamations of the
people, and bonefires, by the name of Richard <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> And
it is reported he assumed majesty with such a boon grace
and affable deportment, that immediately he won the affections
and admiration of all who made addresses unto
him; in which art of kingship he had long before been
educated and instructed by his pretended aunt, Margaret
Duchess of Burgundy, sister to King Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> which
he had also acted to the good liking of all that saw him in
Burgundian, Irish, Scots, and French courts. And, moreover,
besides his magisterial port and mien, being an incomparable
counterfeit, natural crafty, liar and dissembler,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare,”</span> as the old proverb
saith; so that in short time he grew to be so popular
and formidable about Bodmin that no power durst oppose
him there. But, alas! this Cornish regniculum gave him
not content, for his pride and ambition put him upon further
expedients, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> to get possession of the whole kingdom
of England, and reduce it also to his obedience; in
order to which, with a well-prepared army of four thousand
men and two thousand of other sorts, he marched out of
Cornwall into Devon, where met him also great numbers
<!--193.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
of volunteers of that county and Somerset, that joined with
his forces; the dread whereof so terrified James Chudleigh,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> then Sheriff of Devon, and the power of his
bailiwick raised to stop his march to Exeter, that they
durst not give him battle or obstruct his passage till he
came before that city, pitched his camp, and laid siege
thereto.</p>

<p>Upon whose approaches the citizens shut their gates and
prepared to defend themselves; when soon after he sent a
message or summons to them in the name of Richard <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
King of England, commanding them to surrender the same
to him upon their allegiance: but the citizens so ridiculed
his pretended title, and slighted his summons, that by his
own messenger they gave him defiance; at which time Dr.
Richard Redman was Lord Bishop of Exeter; William
Burgoigne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Recorder; William Frost, Mayor; Francis
Gilbert, Sword-bearer; John Bucknam, William Wilkinson,
John Doncaster, and Richard Howse, were Stewards,
or Bailiffs; John Clodworthy, John Bonifant, Philip Bullock,
John Wilkin, Nicholas Auburne, John Atwell, William
York, Thomas Lanwordaby, Philip Binks, John Slugg,
Thomas Andrews, Thomas Oliver, and others, Aldermen.
See Isaack’s Memorials of Exeter, 1499.</p>

<p>Soon after this defiance given, Perkin and his soldiers
surrounded the city walls, and attempted to scale the same
in several places daily for some time, but always were repulsed
with considerable loss by the valour of the citizens.
During which siege they sent to King Henry for his aid
and assistance in this great distress; whereupon the Lord
Daubeny was ordered to raise forces and march towards
Exeter therewith, in order to remove the siege thereof;
but before he came, Edward Courtenay, sixteenth Earl of
Devon, and the Lord William his son, accompanied with
Sir Edmund Carew, Sir Thomas Fulford, Sir William
Courtenay, Sir John Halwell, Sir John Croker, Walter
Courtenay, Peter Edgecombe, William <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maur, Richard
Whiteleigh of Efford (Sheriff of Devon the year after),
<!--194.png--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
Richard Hals of Kenedon, John Fortescue of Vallapit,
James Chudleigh aforesaid, and other gentlemen of those
parts, had raised a considerable army of soldiers, with
which they marched towards the rebels. At the sight of
whose approach Perkin and his host were as much dispirited
then as they were elevated before; whereupon he called a
council of war, in which it was unanimously agreed upon,
that it was not advisable to give them battle, being at least
ten thousand fighting men, but to dislodge from their
trenches, and leave the siege of that place, and forthwith to
march into Somersetshire, a country better affected to King
Perkin, where he might raise more soldiers. Accordingly,
this order of council was observed and put in practice, so
that the night after Perkin and all his army marched towards
Taunton; where he mustered his men as if he intended
to give battle; but when, by the muster-roll, he
saw what numbers of men had deserted him in his nightly
march from Exeter, falling then much short of six thousand,
and further, notice being brought him that King Henry
was in pursuit of him with a much greater army, he foresaw
the worst, and doubted that fortune would favour him no
longer in his military and regal practices; and therefore
contrived, for the preservation of himself, with sixty horse
troopers, to forsake his army by night, and fly to the Abbey
of Beauley, in Southampton, as resting upon the name and
privilege of the place, where he took sanctuary. As soon
as King Henry understood Perkin had deserted his soldiers
and had taken sanctuary at Beauley, he forthwith ordered
a band of soldiers to guard and surround that Abbey to
prevent his escape beyond the seas (from whence it appears
that at that time the privilege of sanctuary was allowed
to traitors). So that Perkin, despairing of getting thence,
submitted to the King’s mercy, and was committed prisoner
to the Tower of London; from whence he made an escape,
and fled to the Priory of Sheen, at Richmond; where, on
condition of making a true confession who he was, in a pair
of stocks set before Westminster Hall door, and true answer
<!--195.png--><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
make to such questions as should be demanded of
him, the Prior got the King’s pardon for him. And accordingly,
he sat in the stocks a whole day before Westminster
Hall door, afterwards on a scaffold in Cheapside,
openly reading, declaring, and giving manuscripts under
his own hand, wherein he told his parentage, the place of
his birth, the passages of his life; that he was a cheat, an
impostor, and by what ways and means he was drawn into
those treasonable and bloody attempts and practices, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
After which he was again committed to the Tower of London,
where endeavouring to make an escape, he was afterwards,
with others, executed at Tyburn.</p>

<p>After Perkin took sanctuary at Beauley, his soldiers from
about Taunton and elsewhere, were all brought to Exeter;
where King Henry, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s church-yard, pardoned
them all, on their promise of being good subjects afterwards.
But some of them were not so good as their word. King
Henry also then sent the Lord Daubeny to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s
Mount for Perkin’s wife, the Lady Katherine Gordon,
whom he brought to King Henry; who commiserating her
youth, birth, and beauty, bestowed a competent maintenance
upon her, which she enjoyed during that King’s life
and long after, to her dying day.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">PART <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></p>

<p>This Priory, or Abbey, being dissolved by act of Parliament,
and given to the King, <abbr title="thirty-third">33d</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> 1542,
he gave the revenues and government of the place to
Humphry Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of the Lanherne family, who enjoyed
the same till the first year of King Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> 1549;
at which time that King set forth several injunctions about
religion: amongst others, this was one, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that all images
found in churches, for divine worship or otherwise, should be
pulled down and cast forth out of those churches; and that
all preachers should perswade the people from praying to
saints or for the dead; and from the use of beads, ashes,
<!--196.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
processions, masses, dirges, and praying to God publicly in
an unknown tongue; and least there should be a defect of
preachers as to those points, homilies were made and
ordered to be read in all churches. Pursuant to this injunction
one Mr. Body, a commissioner for pulling down
images in the churches of Cornwall, going to do his duty
in Helston church, a priest, in company with Killtor of
Kevorne and others, at unawares stabbed him in the body
with a knife; of which wound he instantly fell dead in that
place. And though the murderer was taken and sent up
to London, tried, found guilty of wilful murder in Westminster
Hall, and executed in Smithfield, yet the Cornish
people flocked together in a tumultuous and rebellious
manner by the instigation of their priests in diverse parts
of the shire or county, and committed many barbarities
and outrages in the same; and though the justices of the
peace apprehended several of them, and sent them to jail,
yet they could not with all their power suppress the growth
of their insurrection; for soon after Humphry Arundell
aforesaid, Governor of this Mount, sided with those mutineers,
and broke out into actual rebellion against his and
their Prince. The mutineers chose him for the General of
their army, and for inferior officers as Captains, Majors, and
Colonels,&mdash;John Rosogan, James Rosogan, <abbr title="William">Will.</abbr> Winslade
of Tregarrick or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes at Mithian, John Payne of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives, Robert Bochym of Bochym, and his brother, Thomas
Underhill, John Salmon, William Segar; together with
several priests, rectors, vicars, and curates of churches, as
John Thompson, Roger Barret, John Woolcock, William
Asa, James Mourton, John Barrow, Richard Bennet, and
others, who mustered their soldiers according to the rules
of military discipline at Bodmin, where the general rendezvous
was appointed. But no sooner was the General
Arundell departed from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount to exert his
power in the camp and field aforesaid, but diverse gentlemen,
with their wives and families, in his absence possessed
themselves thereof; whereupon he dispatched a party of
<!--197.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
horse and foot to reduce his old garrison; which quickly
they effected, by reason the besieged wanted provision and
ammunition, and were distracted with the women and children’s
fears and cries, and so they yielded the possession to
their enemies on condition of free liberty of departing forthwith
from thence with life, though not without being
plundered.</p>

<p>The retaking of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount by the general
Arundell proved much to the content and satisfaction of
his army at Bodmin, consisting of about six thousand men,
which they looked upon as a good omen of their future
success, and the first-fruits of the valour and conduct of
their general. Whereupon the confederates daily increased
his army with great numbers of men from all parts,
who listed themselves under his banner, which was not
only pourtrayed, but by a cart brought into the field for
their encouragement, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the pyx under its canopy, that is
to say, the vessel containing the Roman host, or sacramental
sacrifice, or body of Christ, together with crosses,
banners, candlesticks, holy bread and water, to defend
them from devils and the adverse power; (see Fox’s Martyrology,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 669,) which was carried wheresoever the
camp removed; which camp grew so tremendously formidable
at Bodmin, that Job Militon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> then Sheriff of
Cornwall, with all the power of his bailiwick, durst not
encounter with it during the time of the general’s stay in
that place, which gave him and his rebels opportunity to
consult together for the good of their public interest, and
to make out a declaration, or manifesto, of the justice of
their cause, and grounds of taking up arms; but the army,
in general, consisting of a mixed multitude of men of
diverse professions, trades, and employments, could not
easily agree upon the subject matter and form thereof. Some
would have no justice of the peace, for that generally they
were ignorant of the laws, and could not construe or English
a Latin bill of indictment without the clerk of the
peace’s assistance, who imposed upon them, with other
<!--198.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
attornies, for gain, wrong sense, and judgment; besides, in
themselves, they were corrupt and partial in determining
cases; others would have no lawyers nor attornies, for that
the one cheated the people in wrong advice or counsel,
and the other of their money by extravagant bills of costs;
others would have no court leets, or court barons, for that
the cost and expense in prosecuting an action at law
therein was many times greater than the debt or profit.
But generally it was agreed upon amongst them, that
no inclosure should be left standing, but that all lands
should be held in common; yet what expedients should be
found out and placed in the room of those several orders
and degrees of men and officers, none could prescribe.</p>

<p>However, the priests, rectors, vicars, and curates, the
priors, monks, friars, and other dissolved collegiates, hammered
out seven articles of address for the King’s majesty;
upon grant of which they declared their bodies, arms, and
goods should all be at his disposal, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr></p>

<p>1. That curates should administer baptism at all times
of need, as well week days as holy days.</p>

<p>2. That their children might be confirmed by the
Bishop.</p>

<p>3. That mass might be celebrated, no man communicating
with the priest.</p>

<p>4. That they might have reservation of the Lord’s body
in churches.</p>

<p>5. That they might have holy bread and water in remembrance
of Christ’s body and blood.</p>

<p>6. That priests might not be married.</p>

<p>7. That the six articles set forth by King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
might be continued at least till the King came of age.</p>

<p>Now those six articles were invented by Stephen Gardiner,
Bishop of Winchester (who was the bastard son of
Lionel Woodvill, Bishop of Salisbury, by his concubine,
Elizabeth Gardiner; the which Lionel was fifth son of
Richard Woodvill, Earl Rivers, 1470), and therefore called
his creed, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr></p>

<p><!--199.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
1. That the body of Christ is really present in the sacrament
after consecration.</p>

<p>2. That the sacrament cannot truly be administered under
both kinds.</p>

<p>3. That priests entered into holy orders might not
marry.</p>

<p>4. That vows of chastity entered into upon mature deliberation,
were to be kept.</p>

<p>5. That private masses were not to be omitted.</p>

<p>6. That auricular confession was necessary in the church
of God.</p>

<p>To those demands of the Cornish rebels the King so far
condescended as to send an answer in writing to every
article, and also a general pardon to every one of them if
they would lay down arms. (See Fox’s Acts and Monuments,
Book ix. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 668.) But, alas! those overtures of the
King were not only rejected by the rebels, but made them
the more bold and desperate; especially finding themselves
unable longer to subsist upon their own estates and money,
or the bounty of the country, which hitherto they had done.
The general therefore resolved, as the fox who seldom
chucks at home, to prey upon other men’s goods and estates
further off, for his army’s better subsistence. Whereupon
he dislodged from Bodmin, and marched with his soldiers
into Devon, where Sir Peter Carew, Knight, was ready to
obstruct their passage with his posse comitatus. But
when they saw the order and discipline of the rebels, and
that their army consisted of above six thousand fighting
men, desperate, well-armed, and prepared for battle, the
Sheriff and his troops permitted them quietly to pass
through the heart of that country to Exeter; where the
citizens, upon notice of their approaches (as formerly
done), shut the gates, and put themselves in a posture
of defence. At which time Dr. John Voysey was
Bishop of Exeter, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 10th July, 1549, John Blacaler
was Mayor, William Tothill was Sheriff, Lewis Pollard,
Recorder, William Beaumont, Sword-bearer; John
Drake, Geffery Arundell, Henry Maunder, and John
<!--200.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
Tooker, were Bailiffs or Stewards; Thomas Prestwood,
John Maynard, John Webb, William Hals, Hugh Pope,
William Hurst, Nicholas Limmet, Robert Midwinter,
Henry Booth, John Berry, John Britnall, John Tuckfield,
John Stawell, Edward Bridgman, Thomas Grigg, John
Drake, Thomas Skidmore, John Bodley, and others (all
which had before that time been Mayors), Stewards or
Bailiffs of the city.&mdash;See Isaack’s Memorials of Exeter,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122.</p>

<p>Things being in this posture, the general Arundell summoned
the citizens to deliver their town and castle to his
dominion; but they sent him a flat denial. Whereupon,
forthwith he ordered his men to fire the gates of the city,
which accordingly they did; but the citizens on the inside
supplied those fires with such quantities of combustible
matter, so long till they had cast up a half-moon on the
inside thereof, upon which, when the rebels attempted to
enter, they were shot to death or cut in pieces. Their
entrance being thus obstructed at the gates, they put in
practice other expedients, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> either to undermine the
walls or blow them up with barrels of gunpowder, which
they had placed in the same; but the citizens also prevented
this their design, by countermining their mines and
casting so much water on the places where their powder
barrels were lodged, that the powder would not take fire.
Thus stratagems of war were daily practised between the
besieged and besiegers, to the great hurt and damage of
each other.</p>

<p>King Edward being informed by his council of this siege,
and that there was little or no dependance upon the valour
and conduct of the Sheriff of Devon, and his bailiwick,
to suppress this rebellion or raise the siege of Exeter,
granted his commission to John Lord Russell, created
Baron Russell of Tavistock by King Henry, and Lord
High Admiral and Lord Privy Seal, an old experienced
soldier who had lost an eye at the siege of Montrueil in
France, to be his general for raising soldiers to fight those
<!--201.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
rebels; who forthwith, pursuant thereto, raised a considerable
army and marched with them to Honiton; but when
he came there he was informed that the enemy consisted
of ten thousand able fighting men armed; which occasioned
his halting there longer than he intended, expecting greater
supplies of men, that were coming to his aid under conduct
of the Lord Grey; which at length arrived and joined
his forces, whereupon he dislodged from thence and marched
towards Exeter; where on the way he had several sharp
conflicts with the rebels with various success, sometimes
the better and sometimes the worse; though at length, after
much fatigue of war, maugre all opposition and resistance
of the rebels, he forced them to raise their siege, and entered
the city of Exeter with relief, 6th August, 1549, after
thirty-two days’ siege; wherein the inhabitants had
valiantly defended themselves, though in that extremity
they were necessitated by famine to eat horses, moulded
cloth, and bread made of bran; in reward of whose loyalty
King Edward gave to the city for ever the manor of
Evyland, since sold by the city for making the river Exe
navigable.</p>

<p>After raising the siege as aforesaid, the general Arundell
rallied his routed forces of rebels, and gave battle to the
Lord Russell and the King’s army, with that inveterate
courage, animosity, and resolution, that the greatest part
of his men were slain upon the spot, others threw down
their arms on mercy, the remainder fled, and were afterwards
many of them taken and executed. Sir Anthony
Kingston, Knight, a Gloucestershire man, after this rebellion
was made Provost Marshal for executing such western
rebels as could be taken, or were made prisoners in Cornwall
and Devon, together with all such who had been
aiders or assisters of them in that rebellion; upon whom,
according to his power and office, he executed martial law
with sport and justice (as Mr. Carew and other historians
tell us); and the principal persons that have come to my
knowledge, over whose misery he triumphed, was Boyer
<!--202.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
the Mayor of Bodmin; Mayow of Clevyan, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb
Major, whom he hanged at the tavern sign-post in
that town, of whom tradition saith his crime was not
capital; and therefore his wife was advised by her friends
to hasten to the town after the Marshal and his men, who
had him in custody, and beg his life. Which accordingly
she prepared to do, and to render herself the more amiable
petitioner before the Marshal’s eyes, this dame spent so
much time in attiring herself and putting on her French
hood then in fashion, that her husband was put to death
before her arrival. In like manner the Marshal hanged
one John Payne, the Mayor, or Portreeve of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, on
a gallows erected in the middle of that town, whose arms
are still to be seen in one of the fore-seats in that church,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a plain field three pine apples. Besides those he
executed many more in other places in Cornwall, that had
been actors, assisters, or promoters of this rebellion.
Lastly, it is further memorable of this Sir Anthony Kingston,
that in Sir John Heywood’s Chronicle he is taxed of
extreme cruelty in doing his Marshal’s office aforesaid. Of
whom Fuller, in Gloucestershire, gives us this further
account of him: that afterwards, in the reign of Queen
Mary, being detected, with several others, of a design to
rob her exchequer, though he made his escape and fled
into his own country, yet there he was apprehended and
taken into custody by a messenger, who was bringing
him up to London in order to have justice done upon him
for his crime, but he being conscious of his guilt, and despairing
of pardon, so effectually poisoned himself that he
died on the way, without having the due reward of his
desert.</p>

<p>After the death of Humphrey Arundell, Governor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Mount, executed for treason as aforesaid, King
Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> sold or gave the government and revenues
thereof to Job Militon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> aforesaid, then Sheriff of Cornwall,
during his life; but his son dying without issue male,
the government, by what title I know not, devolved upon
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
the Bassets of Tihidy, from some of whom, as I am informed,
it came by purchase to Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>
now in possession thereof.</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1676, at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount,
about four of the clock in the afternoon, came from the
British ocean, or sea, a ball of fire, seen by the inhabitants
and fishermen at sea, which struck against the south moorstone
wall of this Mount’s church or chapel; where, meeting
resistance from the wall, it glanced through the stones
thereof with some rebounds, making a path, or strake,
through the same, in some places about four inches broad
and two inches deep, from one end of the long side wall
almost to the other; and from thence, by another rebound,
it struck the strong oak durns of the dwelling-house entry,
and broke the same in two or three pieces, and so flew
into the hall, where it fell to the ground, having spent its
force and strength as aforesaid, and then brake asunder
in pieces, by the side of Mrs. Catherine <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, without
doing her any manner of hurt, leaving a sulphurous
smoke behind it in the room; which ball of fire then
appeared to consist of a black-blue metally matter, congealed
or melted by fire like as coal and cinders may be, as
Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, the elder, and other spectators told
me.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not any thing in addition to Mr. Hals,
except an uninteresting dissertation to prove that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Mount is not the Ocrinum of Ptolemy.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">WHITAKER.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker has given several notes and comments
on the narrative of Mr. Hals, which will here be placed,
together with references to the passages to which they
relate.</p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 170. (<a name="FNa" id="FNa"></a><a href="#fna"><span class="decoration">a</span></a>) The name is Mara-zion, or zien, on the sea, I

believe, and Market-Jew is merely a similar appellation in
English. A Jew, in Cornish language, is Ethow, and
Edheuon, Ethchan, are Jews.</p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 170. (<a name="FNb" id="FNb"></a><a href="#fnb"><span class="decoration">b</span></a>) This corrects Mr. Willis, in <abbr title="xtwo">ii.</abbr> 3, who there
says of the Market-Jew, and other towns expressly, “none
of them ever sent Members to Parliament, or were ever
summoned so to do.” Yet it coincides exactly with what
Dr. Brady remarks in his very valuable treatise on Boroughs,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57, 59, and adds one more to his few returns,
and instances of very many more which might have been
produced “if needful,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 59.</p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 172. (<a name="FNc" id="FNc"></a><a href="#fnc"><span class="decoration">c</span></a>) Sel, sil, or sul is merely a view, or prospect,

the hill of prospect.</p>

<p>(<a name="FNd" id="FNd"></a><a href="#fnd"><span class="decoration">d</span></a>) The real name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount in Cornish
is this, Carreg luz en kuz, a hoary rock in a wood. Borlase’s

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 178. (<a name="FNe" id="FNe"></a><a href="#fne"><span class="decoration">e</span></a>) This notice, unobserved by the noticer himself,
lets us into a part of the history of this Mount, which has
never been unfolded yet. There was plainly a nunnery here,
as well as a monastery. Accordingly we find before what this
circumstance alone explains, that there were two chapels
upon the Mount. One is described before as “a little chapel
yet standing, and dedicated to the Archangel <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael,
part whereof is now converted to a dwelling-house.” The
other is thus, as “that which renders this place most famous,
the present church or chapel, yet extant, and kept
in good repair with pews; upon the tower of this church
or chapel, for it is bigger than many other Cornish
parish churches, is that celebrated place called Kader-Migell,
i. e. Michael’s chair.” So distinct are these
chapels! The monastery I apprehend to have been,
“where, towards the north-west, is a kind of level plain
about four or six landyards,” with “a downright precipice
of rocks towards the sea, at least twenty fathoms high.”
And where, about the greater chapel, are “cells cut in the
<!--205.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
rocks for hermitical monks of the aforesaid order.” And
the nunnery I suppose to have been where, “from this
little square, or plain, there is an artificial kind of ascent
going towards the east, which offers you a full sight of the
outer walls of the castle, and brings you to Porth Horne
(Hourn), part of which is yet to be seen.”</p>

<p>Thus do we get a glimpse of a nunnery that is invisible
from every other point. Tanner, that witness for all other
authors upon monastic notices, gives us no intimation from
any of them concerning this nunnery. Yet Leland confirms
what I have observed in Mr. Hals before, the existence
of two churches, or chapels, upon the summit of the
Mount. “The way to the church,” he says, concerning
the ascent to the top, “entereth at the north side from half
ebb to half flood, to the foot of the Mount, and so ascendeth
by steps and grices westward, and thence returneth
eastward to the utterward of the church,” or Mount.
Within the said ward is a court strongly walled, “wherein
on the south side is the Chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, and in
the east side a chapel of our Lady. The Captain and
priest’s lodgings be in the south side of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s
Chapel.” (Itin. <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 118.) When this Captain was fixed
there with a garrison, as we shall soon see when he was, the
nuns were obliged to relinquish their cells to him and them.
For this reason we have not a hint in all the ages afterwards
of a nunnery here. Only the chapel was continued
for the use of the garrison, while the church itself was still
left to the monks. Such an union as this, of a monastery
and a nunnery upon the summit of a pyramidal hill, and
amid the sequestrations of solitude, carries a strange appearance
with it to our Protestant suspiciousness; yet it
was not very uncommon in the reign of popery. It seems
to have been peculiarly calculated for that purpose for
which both monastery and nunnery were generally calculated,
to shew the triumph of faith over the impulses of
sense, and to shew that triumph more conspicuously, by
the association of monks and nuns in monastic vicinity
<!--206.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
to each other. “This little fortress,” as Mr. Hals has
told us before, “comprehendeth sufficient rooms and
lodgings for the Captain, or Governor, and his soldiers to
reside in,” which I have supposed above “to have been
the original habitations of the nuns and their Abbess; to
which adjoining are several other houses, or cells, heretofore
pertaining to the monks that dwell here, all admirable
for their strength, buildings, and contrivance,” and all
probably therefore contemporary or nearly so.</p>

<p><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 180. (<a name="FNf" id="FNf"></a><a href="#fnf"><span class="decoration">f</span></a>) This account of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount is in a
strain of intelligence and judiciousness much superior to the
general tenor of Mr. Hals’s writings. To it I wish to
add some useful notices, in accompaniment of some that I
have given before.</p>

<p>Upon the very crown and summit of this pyramidal hill,
stands proudly eminent the church, stretching from east to
west, and having a tower in the middle. It was built by
Edward the Confessor, who was the first to consecrate the
Mount to religion, and erected the church on the little plain
at the top of it. Having done this, and erected habitations
for the clergy attending it, he gave them, by charter still
existing in recital, the whole of the Mount, and many lands
beside. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ego Edwardus, Dei gracia Anglorum Rex,
dare volans pretium redemptionis animæ meæ vel parentum
meorum, sub consensu et testimonio bonorum virorum,
tradidi Sancto Michaeli Archangelo, in usum fratrum Deo
servientium in eodem loco, Sanctum Michaelem,”</span> the
church, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“qui est juxta mare.” He also gives them “totam
terram de Venefire;”</span> and proceeds <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“portum addere qui
vocatur Ruminella.”</span> Romney, in Kent. Then came Robert
Earl of Mortaigne, the falsely reputed founder, merely
to associate this church with another of the same appellation
in Normandy, and to enlarge its endowments. In
a new charter, equally as the old without a date, he,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“habens in bello Sancti Michaelis vexillum,”</span> says,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“do et concedo Montem Sancti Michaelis de Cornubiâ
Deo et monachis ecclesiæ Sancti Michaelis de Periculo</span>
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maris servientibus, cum dimidiâ terræ hidâ.”</span> But, as he
adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“postea autem ut certissime comperi, Beati Michaelis
meritis monachorumque suffragiis michi a Deo ex
propriâ conjuge mea filio concesso, auxi donum ipsi beato
militiæ celestis principi, dedi et dono in Amaneth (Quere,
where?) tres acras terræ, Travalaboth videlicet, Lismanoch,
Trequaners, Carmailoc,”</span> <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> 2. And, finally,
comes the Bishop of Exeter, in a charter dated expressly
1085, to free <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ecclesiam Beati Michaelis Archangeli de
Cornubiâ,”</span> from all episcopal jurisdiction. 3. Thus erected
and thus privileged, the church remained till the day of
William of Worcester, and he thus notes the dimensions
of it: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Memorandum, longitudo ecclesiæ Montis Sancti
Michaelis continet 30 steppys, latitudo continet 12
steppys.”</span> 4. Carew also speaks of it as “a chapel for
devotion, builded by William Earl of Morton,” (Carew
so speaking with the multitude, when he ought to have
given the building to the Confessor,) “and greatly haunted
while folk endured (endeared) their merits by farre travailing.”
5. Carew thus refers obscurely, perhaps unconsciously,
to a particular privilege annexed to the church,
which was given by one decree from Pope Gregory, and
confirmed by another from Bishop Leofric. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Universis
Sanctæ Matris ecclesiæ presentes literas inspecturis vel
audituris salutem,”</span> cries the former, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“noverit universitas
vestra quod sanctissimus Papa Gregorius, anno ab incarnatione
Domini millesimo septuagesimo,”</span> the very year,
therefore, in which Earl Montaign gave this church to the
other in Normandy, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ad ecclesiam Montis Sancti Michaelis,
in comitatu Cornubiæ, gerens eximiæ devocionis
affectum, piè concessit ecclesiæ predictæ, [et] omnibus fidelibus,
qui illam cum suis beneficiis et elemosinis,”</span> (with
alms and oblations, so that “folke endeared their merits,”
not merely “by farre travailing,” but by a tax upon their
purse,) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<a name="err5" id="err5"></a>exepecierint seu visitaverint, tertiam partem penetenciarum
suarum eis condonari,”</span> a third of all those acts
<!--208.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
being remitted, which penitents were enjoined to perform,
in order to prove the sincerity of their penitence to God,
and to themselves. The same privilege is repeated by the
Bishop of Exeter in 1085, thus: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“omnibus illis, qui illum
ecclesiam suis cum beneficiis et elemosinis expetierint et
visitaverint, tertiam partem penitentiarum condonamus.”</span>
Yet, what is surprising, the privilege became nearly as
much unknown afterwards as it is at present, and was
therefore promulgated by the clergy of the church at the
beginning of the fifteenth century: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Tota verba,”</span> adds
the reciter, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in antiquis registris de novo,”</span> a little before
William’s visit, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“in hâc ecclesiâ repertis, inventa,”</span> being
then unknown to the very clergy themselves, and only discovered
by the discovery of some registers equally unknown,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“prout his in valvis ecclesiæ publicè ponuntur,”</span> were
exhibited to public view by being posted upon the folding-doors
of the church. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Et quia pluribus istud est incognitum,
ideo nos, in Christo Dei famuli et ministri hujus ecclesiæ,
universitatem vestram qui regimen animarum possidetis,”</span>
all the rectors and vicars of the kingdom, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ob
mutuæ vicissitudinis obtentum requirimus et rogamus, quatenus
ista publicetis in ecclesiis vestris, ut vestri subditi et
subjecti ad majorem exoracionem devocionis attentius animentur,
et locum istum gloriosius peregrinando frequentent
ad dona et indulgencias predicta graciosè consequenda.”</span>
From this republication of the privilege, undoubtedly, did
the numerous resort of pilgrims to the church begin. Then
too was formed assuredly that seat on the tower, which is
so ridiculously described by Carew, as “a little without the
castle&mdash;a bad seat in a craggy place&mdash;somewhat dangerous
for access;” when it is only a chair, composed of stones,
projecting from the two sides of the tower battlements, and
uniting into a seat without the south-western angle, but
elevated above the battlements on each side. It thus appears
somewhat dangerous from the elevation or projection
only, is an evident addition to the tower, and was assuredly
<!--209.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
made at this period for the pilgrims, that they might complete
their devotions at the Mount by sitting in this <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Chair, as denominated, and by showing themselves
as pilgrims to the country round. Hence, in an
author<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> who alludes to customs without feeling the force
of his allusion, we read this intimation:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Who knowes not Michael’s Mount and Chaire,</div>
  <div class="i2">The pilgrim’s holy vaunt?</div>
</div>

<p>We thus find a reason for the construction of such a chair,
that comports with all the purposes of the church on the
tower of which it is constructed, and that shows it ministered
equally with this to the uses of religion then predominant;
making it not, as Carew most extravagantly makes
it, “somewhat dangerous for access, and therefore holy for
the adventure,” but holy in itself, as on the church-tower,
holy in its purposes, as the seat of the pilgrims, and doubly
holy as the seat of accomplishment to all their vows, as the
seat of invitation to all the country. And the whole church
remains to this day, beaten by the rains and buffeted by
the winds, yet a venerable monument of Saxon architecture.</p>

<p>This Mount appears decisively, from the charter of the
Confessor, to have been in his time not surrounded with
the sea during all the flood tide, and not accessible by land
only during some hours of the ebb-tide, as it is at present.
It was then not surrounded at all. It was only near the
sea then. Thus the Confessor describes it expressly, as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sanctum Michaelem qui est juxta mare.”</span> But as Worcestre
adds, with a range back into the past that is very
striking, yet is in general confirmed by the charter above,
“the space of ground upon Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael is two
hundred cubits, surrounded with the ocean,” at flood tide;
“the place aforesaid was originally inclosed with a very
thick wood, distant from the ocean six miles, affording the
finest shelter for wild beasts.”</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.
<!--210.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span></p>

<p>Nothing is known with any certainty respecting the
ancient state of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount.</p>

<p>It may have been the seat of a Celtic superstition somewhat
similar to that imagined and described by Dr. William
Borlase. Sir Christopher Hawkins has adduced many
arguments for proving this semi-island to have been the
Ictis of Diodorus Siculus; and its situation, united to its
sea-port, may well have recommended such a place for a
factory to the merchants of any civilized nation engaged in
commercial transactions with people so rude as were the
Britons of those remote times. The universal practice in
our days, is to establish fortified stations under similar circumstances,
since neither person or property can be effectually
protected in any other way.</p>

<p>The earliest definite tradition of a Christian establishment
dates with the pilgrimage of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kenna, in consequence
of the appearance of the Arch-angel at that place.
No particular circumstances are ever related of this extraordinary
vision, neither as to the occasion nor as to the persons
so eminently favoured as to behold the celestial glory,
nor as to the time, nor of the exact spot, since it could not
have taken place on the top of the tower, that building
having been constructed in honour of the vision itself.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that lofty and elevated situations
throughout Europe are dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, probably
on account of the Archangel being uniformly painted with
wings, and therefore tacitly imagined to have habits similar
to birds; and perhaps the dedication of the largest of our
domestic fowls to the celebration of his festival, may owe its
origin to a similar analogy.</p>

<p>Saint Kenna is believed to have imparted the same identical
virtue to the chair which overhangs the tower, as she
<!--211.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
bestowed on the celebrated well near Liskeard, and since
no one obtains a seat in this chair without much resolution
and steadiness of head, one may be inclined to anticipate
the supposed effect with greater certainty from the achievement
of sitting in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s chair, than from drinking
water from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kenna’s well. The time of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kenna’s
visitation is not accurately known. She is supposed to be
the same <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keyna, daughter of a prince of Brecknockshire,
who lived a recluse life for many years near a town
situated midway between Bristol and Bath, since called
Cainsbarn, after her name, where she founded a monastery
in the beginning of the sixth century, and cleaned the
neighbourhood from snakes and vipers by converting them
all into Cornua Ammonis, which have abounded there
ever since, in testimony of her sanctity and of the fervour
of her prayers.</p>

<p>The supposed ancient site of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, its
being the hoary monk in a wood surrounded by forests, is
deduced from arguments very similar to those which prove
the miraculous power of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kenna in converting serpents
into stones.</p>

<p>Trees have been found buried under the sand and silt
in the Mount’s Bay, as they are frequently found in every
similar inlet of the sea on the southern coast of England.
And the tradition, if a term so respectable may be applied
to such vague conjectures, applies equally to Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael; or they may have been derived from a common
origin. See <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Grand Dictionaire Historique, par M.
Moreri</span>, Paris edition of 1188, with the Supplement of
1735. In the 5th folio volume of the Dictionary, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 193,

<p>As the alien priories were suppressed by Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> who
began his reign in 1413, William Lambert was probably
the last Prior.</p>

<p>Bishop Tanner says, in his Notitia Monastica:&mdash;After
the suppression of the alien priories, this was first given by
King Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> to King’s College, Cambridge, and afterwards
by King Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> to the nunnery of Sion, in
Middlesex. At the first seizure by King Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> the

<p>The charter of Saint Edward may be thus translated:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity. I
Edward, by the grace of God King of the English, willing
to give the price of the redemption of my own soul, or of
the souls of my parents, with the consent and attestation
of good men, have delivered to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael the Archangel,
for the use of the brethren serving God in that place, Saint
Michael, which is near the sea, with all its appendages,
that is to say, with its towns, castles, lands, and other appurtenances.
I have added, moreover, all the land of
Vennefire, with its towns, villages, fields, meadows, and
grounds, cultivated or uncultivated, with their proceeds.

to it, that is, with mills and establishments for
fisheries and with their proceeds.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“But if any one shall endeavour to interpose subtile impediments
against these gifts, let him be made an anathema,

<!--216.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
eve of the blessed Michael in monte tumbæ, and on the following
day, provided that these fairs and markets may not
cause any damage or injury to other fairs or markets, in
conformity with the laws and customs of this kingdom of
England.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In witness of all which things we have thought fit to
certify this present confirmation with our royal seal.”</p>

<p>There is also a bull of Pope Adrian, in the year 1155,
confirming all their possessions to the Abbat and monks of
Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, and among them Saint Michael’s
Mount, in Cornwall; which, previously to its subjugation,
had been exempted from all episcopal interference by Liuricus
Bishop of Exeter, as he states by the exhortation and
command of his Lord, Pope Gregory, and in compliance
with the wishes of the King, of the Queen, and of all the
magnates in the realm. And he also grants a release from
a third part of their penances to all such persons as may
visit this church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael with oblations and alms.</p>

<p>The Mount appears never to have received a religious
society after its suppression as an alien priory in the
reign of King Henry the Fifth. At the period of the general
dissolution it must have been let at an annual rent,
for in the abstract roll preserved in the Augmentation
Office this entry occurs under Syon Abbey: “Cornub.&mdash;S.
Michael. ad Montem, Firma 26<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>”</p>

<p>The history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount since its dissolution,
as a parcel of Sion Abbey, is very far from being clear.
It appears to have been granted at first for terms of years
to different gentlemen of the neighbourhood. To Millington,
supposed of Pengersick, in Breage; to Harris, of
Kenegie, in Gulval; and perhaps jointly with Millington
to a Billett or Bennett. A person of that name, half-deranged,
who died about the middle of the last century,
continued during the whole of his life to shoot rabbits on
the Mount one day in the year by way of maintaining a
supposed right, which, being utterly groundless, was
humanely allowed to pass unobserved.</p>

<p><!--217.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
Queen Elizabeth, or King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> appears to have
granted the whole in fee to Robert Cecil, created Earl of
Salisbury May 4, 1605. But the Mount was seised into
his own hands by King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> just at the breaking
out of the civil war, probably on account of the great
military importance of this hold, when William Cecil, son
of the former, having subscribed the Declaration made at
York, on the 13th of June, 1642, left the party of which
the King was at the head, and joined the opposite party in
London.</p>

<p>An order was soon after given to Sir Francis Basset,
then Sheriff of Cornwall, to place the Mount in a state of
defence, and to supply it with ammunition and provisions;
and it is not improbable that a grant was made of the
castle and Mount to Sir Francis Basset at once, in witness
of his zeal displayed in the cause, and as some indemnity
for the expenses he had incurred, the royalist party never
having had any considerable sum of money at their command.</p>

<p>The Bassets having suffered extremely in their property
by efforts made during the war, and by compositions afterwards,
it was found convenient to sell <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount
about the year 1660; when it was most fortunately purchased
by Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, in whose opulent family,
and through five John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyns, it has descended to the
present possessor of that name.</p>

<p>Every individual of this family has proved himself desirous
of supporting, of maintaining, and of beautifying one
of the most extrordinary spots in the whole world.</p>

<p>Including Dartmoor and the Scilly Islands, granite
breaks out into six large but unequal masses, which, like
the <a name="err6" id="err6"></a>Appeninnes of Italy, extend a narrow promontory into
the sea. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount presents a ridge of granite
equally distinct with any of these great masses, and rises
into a lofty cone, the base being surrounded by the killas, a
peculiar schist, the chief metalliferous rock of Cornwall.</p>

<p><!--218.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
And here most of the curious phenomena are found
which occur at the junction of these two rocks.</p>

<p>The buildings on the summit are grand and appropriate
to the scenery, and venerable from their antiquity. The
church, with its tower, completing the pyramidal figure of
the whole, are supposed to date so far back as the reign
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward. And a modern addition of two rooms on
the eastern part of the building, made by the late Sir
John Aubyn about the year 1750, is in complete harmony
with the other parts, and adds to the general effect.</p>

<p>The inside of the castle, or priory, has been much decorated
within a few years, and florid gothic ornaments
have been added to the exterior; but opinions are much
divided as to the accordance of these new parts with buildings
to which Sir Walter Scott’s line may be applied,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">In Saxon strength the Abbey frown’d.</div>
</div>

<p>At the foot of the Mount a small pier existed from a
time probably anterior to the Monastery itself, but in the
early part of the last century a lease on lives was granted to
Mr. George Blewett, the early associate and in some degree
rival of the great Mr. Lemon. This gentleman rebuilt
the pier on a very enlarged scale, and concentrated here
almost the whole commerce of Penwith hundred, which
has since his time gone to Penzance and Hayle.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount is said to be selected as the scene
of many strange adventures, in Italian romances; while
Cornwall is supposed to abound with enchanters, goblins,
and other supernatural beings.</p>

<p>An English romance, once popular with the old and with
the young, but now banished even from our nurseries, begins
thus:</p>

<p>“In the days of King Arthur the Mount of Cornwall
was kept by a monstrous giant.” ma</p>

<div class="poem" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
  <div class="i0">Tasca Argo i Mini, e tascia Artu qui’ suoi</div>
  <div class="i0">Erronti, che di sogni empion le carte.</div>
</div>

<p>Marazion has certainly to boast of very great antiquity.
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
It may have existed in the earliest times, if the Mount really
afforded protection to the Eastern merchants, who sought
the shores of Cornwall for its tin.</p>

<p>And the names Marazion and Marketjew cannot but excite
an inclination to believe that in the Middle Ages this
place may have been the resort of the most extraordinary
people, who at all times have manifested a peculiar inclination
for dealing in metals; it is moreover worthy of remark
that all remains of places where tin has heretofore
been smelted in the most simple manner, are invariably
denominated Jew’s Houses. Marazion must also have afforded
shelter and entertainment to the crowds of pilgrims
assembling at particular periods to adore the Shrine of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael, and to participate in the indulgence granted by
Liuricus Bishop of Exeter, on the exhortation of his Lord
the Pope.</p>

<p>Marazion received a charter of incorporation from Queen
Elizabeth, but the town, although beautifully situated, has
not kept pace in the career of improvement with many
others, and especially not with Penzance.</p>

<p>About the middle of the last century, which was the
great epoch for the establishment of turnpike roads, as the
beginning of this century will be considered for their improvement
on principles of science and of general accommodation,
a turnpike road was laid out from Falmouth,
through Penryn and Helston, to the western<a name="err7" id="err7"></a> of Marazion,
by which a new entrance was opened from Penzance; and
about the year 1775 a large castellated house was built at
the western extremity of the town, by Mr. John Blewett,
son of Mr. George Blewett, the very considerable merchant
noticed above, in imitation of the house at Tregenna,
near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive’s, built by Mr. Samuel Stephens a few years
before, under the direction of Mr. Wood, an architect from
Bath, who had constructed most of the splendid works in
that city.</p>

<p>Mr. George Blewett, rising from the lowest origin, is
said to have accumulated a hundred thousand pounds. On
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
the death of his only son the property went to a nephew,
and the whole has been dissipated.</p>

<p>The house was some time afterwards purchased by another
Mr. Blewett, wholly unconnected with the former,
who acquired a considerable fortune in the war: that has
also entirely disappeared, and the house has passed into
other hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Pascoe Grenfell, Commissary to the States of Holland,
resided here during a long life, although he was originally
of Penzance; and here was born his son Mr. Pascoe
Grenfell, junior, well known throughout England as an
active Member of Parliament, as a man of talent and of
great liberality, commensurate to his almost unexampled
success in commerce.</p>

<p>From Marazion also have sprung the family of Cole.</p>

<p>Captain Francis Cole would have risen to the most elevated
station in the Navy if he had not been cut off by an
early death.</p>

<p>Captain Christopher Cole most justly acquired the
highest military reputation by his capture of Banda in the
East Indies, with a force several times less numerous than
the garrison which he overcame; and, having taken the
place with such an union of courage, determined resolution,
and of prudence, as would rival the exploits of chivalry,
he acquired still greater glory by extending a truly heroic
courtesy to the vanquished, protecting them in their persons,
in their properties, and in the exercise of their religious
and of their civil rights. Having settled, in consequence
of his marriage, in Glamorganshire, he has had the
honour of representing that county in Parliament.</p>

<p>The Reverend John Cole, D.D. attained the high situation
of Rector of Exeter College, Oxford.</p>

<p>And the younger brother, Dr. Samuel Cole, is now
Chaplain-general to the Navy.</p>

<p>The principal inhabitant at present is Mr. William Cornish,
a very respectable merchant and a magistrate for the
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
county; he married a daughter of the elder Captain Cole,
and has a numerous family.</p>

<p>Treveneage seems to have been the principal seat in this
parish. A branch of the Godolphins resided here, having
acquired the property by a marriage with the heiress of an
ancient family denominated Goverigon or Gavrigan, whose
principal residence was in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb.</p>

<p>Katherine Godolphin, daughter and heiress of Francis
Godolphin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Treveneage, married John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn,
of Clowance, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and was buried at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, on the
13th of March 1662, as appears from an inscription on a
monument to her memory in the church.</p>

<p>The barton of Treveneage was however sold, and after
passing through Robinson, it was purchased, about the year
1665, by the family of Tredenham, of Tredenham, or Tredinham,
in Probus.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Tredinham was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1665,
and was knighted. One of his daughters, and eventually
his coheiress, married Scobell of Menigwins, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell;
and from a coheiress of Scobell this barton, together with
an extensive manor, descended to the Hawkins’s of Pennance,
and from them to the late Sir Christopher Hawkins,
of Trewithan in Probus, and of Trewinnard in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth.</p>

<p>Tregembo, or Tregember, bears an appearance of considerable
antiquity. Mr. Lysons says that it belonged to
the family of Grosse, and that it passed by sales, through
King to Penneck, in the year 1684.</p>

<p>The Pennecks were originally of Trescow in Breage, and
advanced themselves in the world by the stewardship and
patronage of the Godolphins. One of this family, the
Reverend John Penneck, who died in 1724, was Chancellor
of Exeter, and would probably have been advanced
much higher in the church if the Marlborough and Godolphin
administration had remained longer in the possession
of power.</p>

<p>On this gentleman’s decease, without children, his property
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
devolved on the Reverend John Penneck, vicar of
Gulval, who married &mdash;&mdash; Wroughton, and left two sons
and two daughters; John, who succeeded him in the living
of Gulval, and Charles, bred to the law, but who quitted
that profession for the militia during the American War.</p>

<p>Mr. John Penneck died in 1789, and his brother in
1801; they were succeeded by their two sisters, who were,
Catherine, married to the Reverend William Borlase,
son and eventually sole heir of the Reverend Walter Borlase,
<abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr> of Castlehorneck; and Ann, married to John
Bingham Borlase, M.D. who had the honour of bestowing
his early medical education on Sir Humphrey Davy. Each
of these sisters left an only daughter. Ann, daughter
of the eldest, married to the Reverend Mr. Peters; and
Ann, daughter of the second, married to Captain Pascoe.</p>

<p>The manor of Tregurtha also belonged to the Pennecks,
having been purchased in the early part of the last century;
but this manor, together with a large portion of their other
possessions, were sold by the two last brothers. This
manor was bought jointly by Mr. Carne, of Penzance, and
the late Mr. Thomas Grylls, of Helston. Tregembo still
belongs to the two ladies.</p>

<p>Ennis, usually called Ninnis, was for some time a gentleman’s
seat, although it is now become a mere farm. Mr.
Humphrey Millett, the last resident gentleman, had been
a member of Exeter College. He married Mary, daughter
of Mr. Sandys, of Helston, and dying early in life left
two daughters his coheiresses. The eldest daughter, Mary,
married Thomas Grylls, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and the second daughter,
Grace, married Charles Short, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Devonshire, Clerk
of the Rules in the Court of King’s Bench, and both have
families. The widow married secondly George Trework,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Penzance.</p>

<p>Trevarthen has the appearance of a place respectable
in former times. The freehold belongs to the Duke of
Leeds, as heir of the Godolphins; but it was held for a long
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
period of years on a lease for lives by one of the numerous
branches of the family of Davies, now all extinct.</p>

<p>This parish has abounded in mines, especially in the
manors of Treveneage and Tregurtha; but the most remarkable
in its consequences was a mine called Whele
Fortune, on Trowall or Truthwell, belonging to Lord Godolphin,
as it enabled Mr. Lemon to move on the great
scale which afterwards so eminently distinguished him; as
it laid the foundation of Mr. Blewett’s large fortune; and
brought forward Captain Dewen, whose fortune descended
on two daughters, one married to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George
Borlase, Fellow of All Souls, and son of the historian; the
other married to Mr. Keir, a gentleman in the profession
of medicine.</p>

<p>The church is situated on a commanding elevation, and
would be an imposing object throughout the whole neighbourhood,
if it were not disfigured by an insignificant spire.</p>

<p>The church and churchyard contain several monuments
to the Godolphins, Pennecks, Milletts, Blewetts, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>On a stone, now made the floor of a seat in the south-
east corner of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary church, is the following curious
inscription to one of the Godolphins.</p>

<p>In connection with the church, one of those casual coincidences
may be noticed, which continued to be remembered
and cited for more than a century in this parish, and
to obtain belief or discredit, as an interposition of Providence,
according to the religious or the political opinions
of those who heard or related it.</p>

<p>It seems that a Mr. Palmer held this living previously to
the Restoration of King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and that he was one
among the two thousand, who in obedience to the dictates
of their consciences, from the fear of disgrace, or from political
motives, refused, “In the church, chapel, or place
of public worship belonging to their benefices or promotions,
upon some Lord’s Day before the Feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew,
which should be in the year of our Lord God
one thousand six hundred and sixty-two, openly, publickly,
and solemnly to read the morning and evening prayer, appointed
to be read by and according to the Book of Common
Prayer, at the times thereby appointed, and after such
reading thereof, and openly and publickly before the congregation
there assembled, to declare their unfeigned assent
to the use of all things in the said book contained and
prescribed.” See the Act of Uniformity, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno decimo
tertio et quarto Caroli</span> <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> ch. 4.</p>

<p>In consequence of this refusal the two thousand incumbents
were ejected without any provision or allowance
whatever, so that many of them perished from actual want.
Several thus ejected without doubt continued the exercise
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
of their sacred functions among such as were desirous or
willing to assist at them; and for this offence Mr. Palmer
was called before magistrates appointed by the new government,
who ordered his commitment to prison, when the
ejected vicar is said to have addressed Mr. Robinson, of
Treveneage, one of the magistrates, in the words of Micaiah,
“If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not
spoken by me.”</p>

<p>Within a short time after this vaticination Mr. Robinson
met his death by the goring of his own bull.</p>

<p>It would be inexcusable in me if I were to leave this
parish without noticing the late Vicar, from whose kindness
I received information whenever it was asked, in those sciences
which have afforded me uninterrupted entertainment
and delight throughout the whole continuance of a protracted
life.</p>

<p>The Reverend Malachy Hitchins was born in the parish
of Gwenap, about the year 1740; possessed of hereditary
claims to mathematical attainments as the nephew of Mr.
Thomas Martyn, well known by his excellent map of
Cornwall published about that time; a map then equalling
if not surpassing the best county maps of England,
and still almost unrivalled for minute and accurate topography,
including the boundaries of parishes&mdash;the work of
fifteen years labour.</p>

<p>I have not succeeded in acquiring any information respecting
Mr. Hitchins in his early years, with the exception
of a general report of his being then distinguished by the
ability, accuracy, and diligence conspicuous in his future
years.</p>

<p>These qualities, and probably his near connection with
Mr. Martyn, recommended Mr. Hitchins as an assistant
to Mr. Benjamin Donne in constructing a map of
Devonshire, an occupation decisive of his future life,
for at Bideford he became acquainted with Miss Hockin,
whom he married, and acquiring with her an accession
of fortune, he proceeded to Oxford, and became a
member of Exeter College, with the view of obtaining
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
orders. But Mr. Hitchins possessed talents and acquirements
that could not admit of his remaining undistinguished
at a place of learning. He was soon noticed by the mathematicians,
and recommended to the Reverend Nevil Maskelyne,
Astronomer Royal, to assist him at the Royal Observatory;
and when Doctor Maskelyne went to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helena,
in the year 1761, to observe the transit of Venus, and
to ascertain, if it were possible, the parallax of Sirius, Mr.
Hitchins had the whole care of the Observatory entrusted
to his hands.</p>

<p>Another object of Doctor Maskelyne’s voyage, and one
eventually of by far the greatest importance, was to prove
from actual experience that Longitudes at sea might be
derived from observations on the moon. Tables founded
on the theory of gravitation and of inertia, as laid down
by <span class="sc">Sir Isaac Newton</span>, had then been constructed by
Tobias Mayer, of Gottingen, and communicated to Dr.
Maskelyne in manuscript, representing the moon’s place
at all times in the heavens, within narrow limits; and the
admirable instrument invented by Mr. John Hadley, by
rendering the apparent contact of two objects, independent
of all agitations of the instrument itself, enabled observers
to ascertain the distance of the moon from the sun, or from
a star, almost as accurately on board a ship as on the solid
land. With these assistances the determination of a ship’s
longitude became an easy problem. The moon is converted
into the hand of a clock, indicating by its distance
from a particular star, the time at Greenwich Observatory
made the first meridian. This distance is ascertained by
Hadley’s sextant, and after applying certain corrections
for parallax and refraction, the time at Greenwich becomes
known. The actual time at the place of observation
is then determined from the altitude of some celestial
body, and thus differences in the longitude required.</p>

<p>Doctor Maskelyne having fully verified the complete
practicability of this method, procured through the Board
of Longitude the publication of Mayer’s tables, accompanied
<!--227.png--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
by a reward or premium, under an Act of Parliament,
to his widow, of three thousand pounds; and soon afterwards
the same eminent and patriotic astronomer devised
and executed a work absolutely necessary for enabling ordinary
persons to avail themselves of this important discovery,
namely the Nautical Almanac, in which the sun’s
place is accurately given for the noon of each day, the
place of the moon for noon and midnight of each day, and
the true angular distance of the moon from the sun, and
from certain stars for every third hour of the day and of
the night throughout the year, together with the equation
of time, the places of the planets, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>: thus saving to observers
perhaps ninety-nine parts out of a hundred of the
calculations that were previously indispensible.</p>

<p>The labour of such a work must obviously require many
hands, especially as without great care in constructing the
original calculation, and in correcting the press, it would
prove worse than useless. To ensure this accuracy, the
most important parts were performed in duplicate by different
persons, and the whole carefully collated and verified
by the superior officer, called the Comparer, under the
ultimate superintendence of the Astronomer Royal himself.</p>

<p>In constructing the first Nautical Almanac that appeared,
for 1767, Mr. Hitchins performed the office of a
computer; but for all the others, up to the period of his
decease in 1809, he most advantageously, not only for this
country but for the whole world, executed the office of
comparer.</p>

<p>The Lunar tables are now carried to a degree of perfection
far exceeding those of Mayer, and the Nautical
Almanac has been enlarged and improved; but the glory
of devising the work remains with Doctor Maskelyne, and
perhaps scarcely a less degree of glory with Mr. Hitchins,
for having conducted it with unrivalled accuracy for a
period extending through so great a number of years.</p>

<p>During his residence at Greenwich Mr. Hitchins had
received holy orders; and, as the office of comparer did
<!--228.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
not confine him to any particular place, he removed to
Exeter, and soon obtained the vicarage of Hennock, to
hold for a minor. He did not fail however of attracting
attention from the clergy of the Cathedral, and about the
year 1774 Bishop Keppell collated him to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, which
had lapsed in consequence of a dispute between two of the
numerous patrons claiming unsettled turns to the presentation.
Here Mr. Hitchins resided respected and admired
till the close of his life, on the 28th of March 1809;
having been distinguished by the succeeding Bishop of
Exeter, Dr. John Ross, who conferred on him the adjoining
vicarage of Gwinear.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchins had four sons and one daughter.</p>

<p>The eldest, Richard, was a Fellow of Exeter College,
and died unmarried on a college living.</p>

<p>The second, Thomas, also a clergyman, married Miss
Emma Grenfell, of Marazion; he served for many years a
church near Plymouth, and has left several children.</p>

<p>The third, Malachy, inherited his father’s genius with his

had occupied in the Royal Observatory; but ultimately
preferring the law, he settled at Marazion, where he died
at an early age in December 1802.</p>

<p>The fourth son, Fortescue, was also in the law, and settled
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive’s. He distinguished himself as a poet and as a
writer, having taken a considerable share in compiling a
History of Cornwall; but his life was also restricted to a

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish is similarly constituted to the adjacent parishes
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth and Gwinear, being all situated on a
line running north-east and south-west, between the large
masses of granite of the Land’s End and of Cambrea.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, adjoining the shore of this parish,
is an object of great attention to the geologist as well as
to the tourist. It is composed almost entirely of granite,
having only two small patches of slate, one on the western
and the other on the eastern side; at these two places, and
more particularly at the latter, the junction of the granite
and of the slate may be seen, the slate being intersected
with numerous granite veins. The granite of the Mount
is not so large-grained as that of the Land’s End; but the
structure of the rock is no where better displayed than at
<!--230.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
this place on the southern side; where the whole mass is
distinctly divided into large quadrangular blocks, and is
traversed in a direction parallel to the divisions, by quartz
veins, which contain crystals of mica, of apatite, and of
topaz, and also the ores of tin, copper, and wolfram, the
latter of which is the most abundant.</p>

<p>One most important geological fact is here beautifully
exhibited. That the mineral composition of granite is
altered in the vicinity of quartz veins, whether they are
metalliferous or otherwise; approaching these veins the
granite becomes more and more siliceous, until at length
it gradually passes into the quartz, which forms the body
(or matrix as it is called) of the veins. A fact difficult to
reconcile with the generally received opinion, which assumes
all veins to have been originally fissures, subsequently
filled up from above or beneath.</p>

Charles Grylls, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> married the daughter and heir

her lands.</p>

<p>Batt-in, Batt-en, in this parish, from which place was
denominated an old family of gentlemen surnamed Battin,
whose only daughter and heir, in the latter end of Queen
Elizabeth’s reign, was married to one Mr. Vincent, a barrister-at-law,
that came down the Western Circuit with
the judges, and so together with herself brought this barton
into his family.</p>

<p>The late possessor, John Vincent, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> sometime Fellow
of All Souls College in Oxford, originally descended, as I
am informed, from the Vincents of Stoke Dabernon in
Surrey, and giveth the same arms, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Azure, three quatrefoils
Argent. His younger brother, Mr. Matthias Vincent,
was bound or bred an apprentice with a merchant at
London, and having but a small fortune to begin trade
with, yet for his care and industry was so taken notice of
in London that he was sent by the East India Company as
one of their factors to Surat in the Mogul’s country, where
by his skill in factorage and merchandize, but chiefly by
marriage with a Portugal merchant’s daughter and heir, he
obtained a great quantity of riches, goods, and chattels;
whereupon he left his servile trade of a factor to others,
and returned with his family and riches safely into England,

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>By far the principal place in this parish is Trebartha,
now for three descents the residence of the very respectable
family of Rodd.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grylls bequeathed her property to Mr. Francis
Rodd, of Herefordshire, a Captain in the Guards, not as
her relation but as her intended third husband. This gentleman
was succeeded by his son Francis Rodd, for many
years Colonel of the Cornwall Militia. He married one of
the three coheiresses of Heale and Paynten, and left three
sons, Francis Heale Rodd, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> the present possessor of
Trebartha; the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Edward Rodd, D.D. and Rector of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just in Roseland, heretofore Fellow of Exeter College,
and Proctor of the University of Oxford in the year 1802;
and Sir John Tremayne Rodd, an Admiral. Also two
daughters, Jane and Harriet, the latter married to Mr.
Fursdon, of Devonshire.</p>

<p>Trebartha is in many respects worthy of being reckoned
among the first places in Cornwall. The scenery, grand
in other respects, is rendered still more so by the addition
of a mountain torrent; and the house has been greatly improved
by the late proprietor and the present, who has
chiefly resided there, highly respected as a magistrate, as
a gentleman, and as the benefactor of his neighbourhood.
Mr. Rodd was a Fellow of All Souls, and during the war
he served, as his father had done before him, in the defence
of his country.</p>

<p><!--233.png--><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
Mr. Lysons says that the Lord of the Manor of Treveniel,
which was passed from the Carews to the Spours,
and from them to Rodd, claims by immemorial custom of
the Mayor of Launceston the service of holding his stirrup
whenever he shall mount his horse in that town in presence
of the Duke of Cornwall; a claim, however, difficult to prove
by any exercise of it, even within legal memory, and now
rendered obsolete by disusage if that effect is ever produced.</p>

<p>The presentation to the living is in Mr. Rodd. The
church is large, consisting of three entire ailes with a lofty
tower, and placed on a commanding eminence. The interior
is adorned with several splendid monuments of the
present and former families resident at Trebartha.</p>

<p>In Wood’s Athenæ Oxonienses may be found the following
account of a native of this parish:</p>

<p>Degorie Wheare was born at Jacobstow in Cornwall;
retired to the habitation of the Muses called Broadgate
Hall (Pembroke College) in the beginning of the year
1592, aged 19; took the degrees in Arts, that of Master
being completed in 1600; elected probationer fellow of
Exeter College; and six years afterwards leaving that
house, travelled into several countries beyond the seas,
by which he obtained as well learning as experience.</p>

<p>At his return he was entertained by the Lord Chandois,
and by him respected and exhibited to. After his death
our author with his wife retired to Gloucester Hall, where
Doctor Hawley, the Principal, demised to him lodgings;
and there he became so well acquainted with Mr. Thomas
Allen, that by his endeavours the learned Cambden made
him his First Reader of his History Lecture which he
founded in the University.</p>

<p>Soon after he was made Principal of the Hall, the which
with his Lecture he kept to his dying day; and was
esteemed by some a learned and genteel man, and by
others a Calvinist.</p>

<p>Having entered at Oxford in the year 1592, aged, as
his friend states, nineteen years, the date of his birth must
be 1573; and it appears from the Fasti of Gloucester Hall,
now Worcester College, that he died in 1647, aged therefore
74. His chief works are,</p>

The lordship of Ty-hiddy, alias Ty-lud-y, in this parish,
hath from the time of Henry the Third, how long before I
know not, been the seat of the ancient and knightly family
of the Bassets, whose first ancestor came out of Normandy
with William the Conqueror 1066, and was posted in
those parts a soldier under Robert Earl of Morton and
Cornwall, of whose posterity (an officer or soldier 17th
Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>) was William Basset, who was then possessed
of £40 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i> in lands and rents in knight service.
Carew’s <abbr title="Survey of Cornwall page">Surv. Corn. p.</abbr> 51. William Basset, of Ty-hyddy,
3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> held in that place and Trevalga, one knight’s
fee of Morton, (idem liber); John Bassett was Sheriff of
Cornwall 28 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> when John Chudleigh was Sheriff
of Devon; John Basset was Sheriff of Cornwall 13 Henry
<abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> when Peter Edgecomb was Sheriff of Devon; John
Basset, Knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall 13 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
when William Courtenay was Sheriff of Devon. The present
possessor, Francis Basset, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married the relict
of Sir William Gerrard, Knight, and after her decease
Pendarves, of Roscrowe family; his father Lucy, the inheritrix
of Heale, of Bradinge; his grandfather, Sir Francis
Basset, Anna, daughter of Sir Jonathan Trelawney, Knight.
Sir Francis Basset’s two younger brothers were bred soldiers;
and in the unhappy wars between King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
and his Parliament, were, for their valour and good conduct
in his service, knighted, but by the unfortunate end and
success of that Prince and his wars, afterwards lived and
died under the pressure of misfortune.</p>

<p>And here I take it worth remembrance that Sir Francis
Basset, Knight, aforesaid, in the beginning of the
reign of King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> in the morning about ten o’clock
on Ty-hyddy downs, himself or his falconer let fly a goshawk
or tassell to a heathpolt or heathcock, which they had
there sprung or started on the wing, which birds of game
and prey in a short while flew eastwards, over <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes
parish, and quite out of sight, so that they despaired of
ever finding them again; but, the next day, before
<!--240.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
twelve o’clock, to their wonder and amazement, a person
sent from the Mayor of Camelford, brought both to Ty-hyddy
to Sir Francis; the hawk well and alive, with his
varvells on his legs, whereon his owner’s name aforesaid
was inscribed, but the heathpolt was dead; which messenger
gave this further account of this rare accident, that
the day before, as near as could be computed, about a quartes
or half an hour after ten o’clock in the morning, the
said hawk, in the midst of Camelford town, struck down his
game dead upon the spot; so that by computation their
flight straight forward, only in half an hour’s space, was at
least thirty-two Cornish miles.</p>

<p>For what reason Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall,
gives such a slighting relation of this famous family, I
know not; his words be these: <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 154, Beyond Nants Mr.
Basset possesseth Ty-hyddy, who married Godolphin, his
father Coffyn, and giveth for his arms as aforesaid.</p>

<p>In this parish, at &mdash;&mdash;, liveth Reginald An-gove, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
i. e. Reginald the Smith, a sirname assumed in memory of
his first ancestor, who was by trade and occupation a smith.</p>

<p>And of this sort of sirname in England, thus speaks
Verstegan,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">From whence came smith, all be it Knight or ’Squire?</div>
  <div class="i0">But from the smith that forgeth in the fire.</div>
</div>

<p>This Reginald Angove is that subtle crafty tinner, whom
common fame reports to have gotten a considerable estate by
labouring, adventuring, and dealing in tin, both in the
mines below and blowing houses above ground, by indirect
arts and practices; for which, about the 8th of William
and Mary, he was indicted before the jury of tinners
(whereof the writer of these lines was summoned for one)
amongst other things, for putting hard heads of false metal
and lead in the midst of slabs of tin, melted and cast in
his blowing-house, in testimony whereof some pieces or
slabs thereof was cut in pieces, and the fallacy detected;
whereupon the Grand Jury returned the bill of indictment,
<!--241.png--><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
indorsed, Billa Vera. But on his trial there was
given a verdict of acquittal.</p>

<p><span class="title">Carne Bray.</span> Upon the top of a very high rocky mountain
in this parish, which takes a large view over the land
from the north to the south sea, that is to say, from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
George’s channel to the British ocean, and also towards the
Land’s End and Scilly islands, stands Castle Carne Bray,
erected long before the art of guns was invented. It is
situate upon the summit of a large, lofty, and tremendous
rock, built four-square of lime and stone, about forty feet high
and twenty feet square; wherein, as appears from the beam
holes, windows, and chimneys, were two planchins, besides
the leads of the top thereof, though now there are not to
be seen either leads or beams, only the walls, windows,
chimneys, and garrets thereof are still extant and uniform,
which, maugre all the force of wind and weather, are likely
to stand firm till the final consummation of all things. It
hath but one way of access or entrance into it, through a
little hole artificially cut in the rock, under the foundation
of its wall, about four feet high; the other parts thereof
being surrounded with inaccessible rocks, carnes, and downfalls.
Some such castle or fortification Cæsar mentions in
his Commentary at Uxelodunum, for Uchell-dun-en, i. e.
the lofty fort or fortress [in Gallia]. I take this castle to
be the Watch Tower mentioned by Orosius, opposite to
such another in Gallicia; which Mr. Carew and Mr. Camden
conjecture stood near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive’s. Near this castle, on
the top of this mountain, are divers circular walls or fortifications,
made of rocks and unwrought stones, after the
British manner (see Gonwallo); and a never intermitting
spring, or fountain of water, for the use of the inhabitants
thereof. Probably this castle was built by some of the
Brays of Cornwall, or those that came into England with
William the Conqueror of that name, otherwise so called
from the natural circumstances of the place, Carne.</p>

<p>In this parish also I take it stands another mountain,
though of less magnitude, called Carne-Kye; but this place
<!--242.png--><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
is much more famous and notable for the great quantities
of tin that have been for many ages, and are still found and
brought to land from the bottoms thereof, than for its
appellation, to the great enriching its lords of the soil and
adventurers.</p>

<p>There is no tradition or memory of the person who built
this costly and tremendous castle aforesaid, or tower; or
for what use it was made other than to dwell in it, comparatively
above the middle region of the air in those parts,
more than what is expressed in the name thereof, Bray’s
Castle. Undoubtedly whatever human creature it was
that dwelt in it and possessed the same, he was a person
that had unparalleled confidence in the strength thereof,
for his safety and protection, such as never any person
after his quitting ever attempted to enjoy for the pleasure
of his five senses.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Tehidy; this lordship of Tehidy has been for many ages
in the possession of the ancient, famous, and knightly
family of Bassets, whose ancestors came out of France with
William the Conqueror, and were posted among the standing
troops in this county under Robert Earl of Morton.</p>

<p>Most certainly they were possessed of this lordship some
short while after the Conquest; and from hence have
sprung many noble and famous men in their generation.</p>

<p>Then, after copying Mr. Hals, Mr. Tonkin goes on to
say,</p>

<p>At Carnekye is a considerable tin-work, chiefly pertaining
to the Bassets, out of which has been raised above a
hundred thousand pounds worth of tin, to the no small
profit of the adventurers and of that family.</p>

<p>At Nants or Nance (the valley) was the dwelling of an
old and well-regarded family of gentlemen, the Trengoves
of Warlegan, the name from Gove, a smith.</p>

<p>These gentlemen have returned to their ancient habitation
<!--243.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
of Trengoff, in the parish of Warlegan; and the present
possessors are denominated Nance from the place,
giving for their arms, Argent, a cross Sable.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin then adds,</p>

<p>Tehidy. The first owner that I meet with of this noble
lordship was Dunstanville; and then Basset, who was his
grandson or nephew. Reginald de Dunstanville was a
Baron of the Realm in the time of King Henry the First,
and I take him to be the person meant in Testa de Neville;
ever since which this lordship has been in this ancient and
noted family. I shall only add, that the family now residing
here, are descended from George Basset, the third son
of Sir John Basset, of Umberly in Devonshire, and of
Tehidy, who had Tehidy for his portion.</p>

<p>Leland saith, “Basset hath a right goodly lordship
called Tehidy by the Cornish. There was some time a
park, now defaced.” And well he might call it a right
goodly lordship, since it hath the advowsons of three large
parishes, this parish, Camborne, and Redruth, with the
royalties of wrecks, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> thereto belonging.</p>

<p>The present lord of the manor is John Pendarves Bassett,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a minor, and at present a Gentleman Commoner
of Queen’s College, Oxford, who is heir in expectance to
his mother of all the estate of Pendarves of Roscrow, and
is likely to come into the estate of the greatest of his ancestors
in this county, by means of this accession, and of
a rich copper mine called the Pool, within this manor,
which has been and is still productive of tin and copper
very rich in the ore.</p>

<p>The arms of Basset are, Or, three bars wavy Gules; but
sometimes these bars are Dancette and the field Argent, as
they are painted in the church windows of Camborne and
Redruth.</p>

<p>The castle and park wall are still standing; and I have
been informed by several old men, particularly by the late
Mr. Udy West, of Redruth, that all the rocky grounds
under Carnbray Castle, and from thence to Porth-Treth,
<!--244.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
were covered with stout trees in their remembrance; so
that squirrels (of which there were many) could leap from
one tree to the other all the way. These were mostly destroyed
in the Civil Wars, and the rest were cut down by
the old Lady Basset, who had it in jointure, so that now
there is not the least sign of any trees ever having grown
there.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>All the attempts at etymology in relation to this parish
have been omitted, on the ground of their not bearing even
the slightest resemblance to probability.</p>

<p>It has been conjectured that Il-luggan may have some
reference to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke, as the parish feast takes place on the
nearest Sunday to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke’s day, October the 18th.
But Luggan, indicating an uncultivated or uninclosed tract
of ground, would seem to bear a near relation to the state
of this district at no remote period.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker adheres to Saint Illuggan on account of
the parish being designated as Ecclesia Sancti Illogani by
the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester in 1294; and
by Cardinal Wolsey. It has been already remarked
that many of the missionaries from the learned and zealous
Convents of Ireland, have left no other trace of their existence
than the names of parishes where they are usually
honoured as Saints; in the sense probably of Holy, and
without implying the technical deification of the Church
of Rome, borrowed from ancient Mythology. Saint Illuggan
may have been one of those who converted the
Celts of Cornwall; but in the total absence even of tradition,
this must be a mere conjecture, and the name does
not seem to bear any analogy to others established by unquestionable
authority.</p>

<p>Every attempt to decipher Tehidy has utterly failed.
<a name="err10" id="err10"></a>Mr. Angowe, who has been brought forward by Mr. Hals
in a manner not likely to acquire for him much respect
<!--245.png--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
from posterity, resided at Trevenson, and left a son,
Mr. Abel Angowe. This gentleman was for some time a
student at Oxford, but ultimately preferred the law as an
attorney. He married Jane, daughter of Mr. Henry Phillips,
of Carnequidden in Gulval, who lived but a very
short time; and Mr. Angowe died in consequence of a
fall from his horse about the year 1767. His large property
became divided among a great many distant relations,
and has almost entirely disappeared. The Angowes held
Trevenson on lease for lives; the freehold being in the
families of Basset and Praed. Mr. Thomas Kivell, steward
to Lord Dunstanville, built a very excellent house there
about the year 1800, which has been still further improved
by his successor in the stewardship, Mr. Reynolds.</p>

<p>Menwinnion existed for centuries as a second house and
appendage to Tehidy; but it is now reduced in size, and
converted to a farm.</p>

<p>Few parishes in Cornwall have flourished in an equal
degree with Illogan. It has abounded in the most productive
mines of copper; the dense population consequent to
these great sources of employment has covered the tracts
formerly waste, with houses, with gardens, and with cultivated
fields; and a safe harbour has been constructed at
Portreath, for the reception of vessels engaged in the reciprocal
trade of exporting annually more than a hundred
thousand tons of copper ore to Swansea, and of bringing
to Cornwall a still larger quantity of coal.</p>

<p>And lastly, on the 25th of October 1809, when a jubilee
was held all over England, on the epoch of King George
the Third commencing the fiftieth year of his reign, Lord
Dunstanville laid the first bar of an iron tram road, for
extending far into the country the facilities afforded by this
harbour and port, which has since been done; notwithstanding
a most illiberal attempt by persons interested in
the trade on the opposite coast, to convert a local Act of
Parliament for improving turnpike roads, the sole object of
which must be to render the conveyance of individuals and
<!--246.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
of property less expensive and more commodious, into the
means of obstructing this great improvement. See the
Journals of the House of Commons for the year 1817, and
particularly on the 16th of May.</p>

<p>But these, and all other improvements in Illogan, and
its general prosperity, are mainly owing to the continued
residence, during six centuries, of one of the most
distinguished among those families, which, having entered
England in hostile array, assimilated themselves to its laws,
its customs, and its institutions; and have been found, in all
succeeding ages, the foremost defenders of its liberties and
of its independence.</p>

<p>The family of <span class="sc">Basset</span> appears to have taken root in
various parts of its adopted country. Some branches were
probably Barons from the earliest times, some attained
that dignity in subsequent periods; others were distinguished
in the law, and all in arms; and what must not be
omitted, the signature of Basset is found in the great
charters of our liberties, at the ratification of Magna
Charta more than six hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals brings down the family of Tehidy to Mr.
John Pendarves Basset, whom he leaves a Gentleman Commoner
of Queen’s College, Oxford. This gentleman married
Ann, the only daughter and heiress of Sir Edmund
Prideaux, of Netherton in Devonshire, by Ann Hawkins,
daughter of Mr. Philip Hawkins, of Pennance, and died
of the small-pox in <a name="yr1739" id="yr1739"></a>1789, at the premature age of twenty-five.
His brother, Mr. Francis Basset, then took possession
of the estate; but, unexpectedly to all parties, the
widow proved to be with child, and a son was born, who
lived to be sixteen, when the uncle came a second time into
possession. During this interval, the guardians of young
Mr. Basset finished the splendid house at Tehidy, commenced
by his father; but, notwithstanding this large expenditure,
so great was the product of the mines, and so considerable
were the rents of the estate, that Mrs. Basset is said to have
acquired above a hundred thousand pounds from her son’s
<!--247.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
personal effects; all of which was naturally left by her
among her own relations.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Basset then settled principally at Tehidy;
married Margaret, daughter of Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, and represented
Penryn in Parliament. Mr. Basset had three
sisters; one married to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Collins, afterwards
presented to the rectory of Redruth; Lucy, the second
daughter, married Mr. John Enys, of Enys, where his great
grandson John Samuel Enys, is now the representative of
that ancient family; the third married Nicholas Sweet
Archer, of Trelaske and of Truro.</p>

<p>Mr. Basset died in 1769, having only completed his fifty-fourth
year, leaving two sons, the eldest called after his own
name; and John, who became a clergyman, held the family
living of Illogan, married Miss Wingfield, and has left
one son.</p>

<p>There were also four daughters; one married Mr. John
Rogers, of Penrose, the other three remained single.</p>

<p>Having now arrived at the period when Sir Francis Basset,
<abbr title="junior">jun.</abbr> came into possession of the family estate, the
Editor would have found it his most pleasing task to trace
an outline, however slight, of this distinguished person, in
his splendid career through public and through private
life. If the topics for his commendation had been in the
least degree doubtful, the Editor would, indeed, have distrusted
his own power of discrimination in reference to one,
whom he is proud to claim, as the most liberal, generous,
warm-hearted, and disinterested friend that it has been his
fortune to obtain in the whole course of a pilgrimage
through life, now exceeding sixty-seven years; but recent
events have made recollections painful, which used to be
associated with every thing most agreeable to the human
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Basset received the earlier part of his education at
Harrow; but about the period of his father’s decease, he
removed to Eton, where, in addition to useful and ornamental
learning, these principles of honour and liberality
<!--248.png--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
identified with the character of a true English gentleman,
are imbibed, practised, and wrought into habit at the early
age when <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sincerum est vas</i>. After which, one can truly say</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will,</div>
  <div class="i0">But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.</div>
</div>

<p>After a residence of five years, from twelve to seventeen,
at Eton, Mr. Basset became a member of King’s College,
Cambridge; and after taking a degree, proceeded on the
usual tour through France and Italy, accompanied by the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Sandys, who, being the son of a former
Steward, had received his education for the express purpose
of becoming tutor to Mr. John Pendarves Basset, who
is stated above to have died at sixteen.</p>

<p>On his return to England, Mr. Basset found himself in
possession of abilities, joined to energy of mind; of a large
estate, accompanied by great accumulations from the mines;
and in addition, of a local influence assuring his introduction
to Parliament. Thus circumstanced, it was natural
for him to take an active share in the politics of his country,
especially at a time when party spirit had acquired a height
never to be attained but in the midst of civil commotions.</p>

<p>The two first Princes of the German line had remained
firmly united with the Whig aristocracy, to whom they
mainly owed what was then denominated their legitimate
or lawful crown, as distinguished from others acquired by
conquest or usurpation, or derived from a succession
founded on no other title than a mere continuance of possession;
but the victory of Culloden having finally extinguished
all hopes in those maintaining, or rather, one
may suppose, professing to maintain, indefeasible hereditary
right, and having apparently established the Whigs
and the legitimate crown, proved nevertheless to be the
cause of their separation, and of the removal of the Whig
aristocracy from power at the next accession.</p>

<p>A mutual feeling naturally grew up, that time must
transfer rights, popularly termed indefeasible, from one
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
race to another, when no prospect of restoration remained;
and the advisers of a young monarch might easily persuade
him, that new friends, holding such tenets, would
prove more acceptable supporters of their adopted crown
than those who originally bestowed it on principles of limitation.
Hence the parts imputed to Lord Bute and others,
the re-action led by Mr. Wilkes, the letters of Junius, and
the final separation of America.</p>

<p>From combinations of these and of other causes, Mr.
Basset found Lord North first Minister of a Tory administration,
and engaged in war with America, and with
France, Spain, and Holland; he eagerly joined that party,
and was subsequently hurried with it into the most fatal
measure that had occurred up to that period, the well
known and well remembered coalition.</p>

<p>But previously to this time, an event had taken place
locally connected with Cornwall, equally honourable to
him who conducted a large of body of miners to the relief
of Plymouth, and to the miners themselves who volunteered
their services.</p>

<p>In the latter part of August 1779, the combined fleets of
France and Spain most unexpectedly steered into Plymouth
Sound, and anchored nearer to the shore than the
base of the present Breakwater.</p>

<p>After the splendid successes of the Seven Years’ War,
marine fortifications had been wholly neglected as utterly
useless, as never to be wanted in future times; but in the
sixteenth year after the peace of 1763, the course of events
demonstrated, that a naval force may be re-established with
much less <a name="effort" id="effort"></a>effect, and in a shorter space of time, than had
been fondly imagined; and perhaps it also proved, that
military navies are not necessarily based on those used for
mercantile purposes.</p>

<p>A well-founded alarm spread immediately throughout
the whole country, that Plymouth was incompetent to sustain
an attack; when instantly the Cornish miners, worthy
of the reputation long enjoyed by their predecessors,
<!--250.png--><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
rushed from all directions, and offered themselves as volunteers
to assist in defending Plymouth, and to exert their
skill and labour in perfecting the works; and Mr. Basset,
acting as his ancestors had done before, immediately placed
himself at their head. Thus a large and efficient force was,
in the course of a few days, added to our most important
western arsenal.</p>

<p>On this occasion a patent was conferred on Mr. Basset,
creating him a Baronet; a gift rendered honourable by the
cause for which it was bestowed.</p>

<p>Since the nautical events of this period have attracted
but little attention from general historians, as they failed of
producing any decisive result, it may be well to state the
most prominent facts.</p>

<p>The English fleet had been detained at home by various
causes, and especially by the court martial which honourably
acquitted Admiral Keppel. It sailed, however, at
last to prevent a junction of the French and Spanish fleets,
but that junction had been effected; and the combined
fleet appeared in Plymouth Sound, while the fleet of England
was cruizing near Ushant, or in the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>Plymouth was undoubtedly open to their attack; and the
individual having the civil government of the dock-yard, is
said to have actually deliberated about taking the last desperate
measure, for depriving the enemy of every advantage
to be derived from acquiring such stores as might be consumed
by fire.</p>

<p>The Ardent, a sixty-four gun ship of the line, arrived
from Portsmouth; and not suspecting that a hostile fleet
could appear upon our coast, and still less occupy our harbours,
continued its course into the midst of the ships, and
became a prize; but not without making a brave resistance,
and endeavouring to escape by running ashore.</p>

<p>The combined fleet, instead of attacking Plymouth,
sailed in quest of the adverse fleet, having manifestly taken
their original course with the view of giving battle; and
what must be mentioned to their honour, not a single act
<!--251.png--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
of wanton hostility was committed on any part of the
coast.</p>

<p>Every thing remained in suspense; watch and ward was
established at all points. The gentlemen in every parish
assembled, such as had arms, to take hasty instructions in
military evolutions, while no one ventured to whisper the
extent of his apprehensions to others, or even to avow them
in his own mind; when, on the last day of August, both fleets
appeared between the Land’s End and the Lizard. In the
night, or in a fog, the fleets had passed each other; and
the Editor remembers seeing the English fleet collected
together in a close mass, making its way up the channel, to
the amount of about forty sail of the line, pursued by the
combined fleet of nearly double that number, in what is
termed, line of battle a-head.</p>

<p>An action now seemed to be inevitable; but for some
unknown cause, the combined fleet discontinued the pursuit
and returned to Brest, while the English fleet anchored
in Tor Bay.</p>

<p>On the dissolution of Parliament in 1784, Sir Francis
Basset exerted himself to the utmost, and made large sacrifices
of money in support of the unpopular coalition ministry,
and he remained stedfast with that defeated party till the
whole political hemisphere became changed in every aspect,
by an event manifested in one country alone, but originating
from causes long in action, and imperceptively working
throughout an entire change of ancient institutions, with
the very form and shape perhaps of civilized society as it
previously stood.</p>

<p>The conflict of opinion which gave rise to the French
Revolution, has but one parallel in the history of mankind;
in the mental agitation, almost amounting to phrensy,
which accompanied and urged forward the great change of
religion three centuries before. That agitation and conflict
still divides Europe, although with diminished violence;
and possibly, therefore, an equal period may elapse
before the questions, relative to civil government and social
<!--252.png--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
order, shall have received their final settlement, if, indeed,
the period is ever to arrive.</p>

<p>Most of those in the dawn of youth possessed of eager
minds and liberal sentiments, were borne along by the torrent
of passions, excited by new systems, promising universal
happiness, with increased wisdom and virtue; founded on
plans for reconstructing human society, derived, it was said,
from philosophical investigation, to be substituted in the
place of patched and mended institutions, originating with
savages in the forests of Scandinavia.</p>

<p>But Sir Francis Basset had the advantage of several
years passed in active experience with the world. He had
learnt that the human faculties are unequal to the formation
of systems <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, but must submit to follow the more
humble course of adaptation, tentative experiment, and
induction; and it was manifest that the new political reasoners
had entirely omitted to consider the real nature of
the ὑλη αμεταχειριστη forming the wide basis of society; or
that they were devising plans not suited to the actual state
of things, but to one which they fondly imagined was about
to be.</p>

<p>Every page of history, moreover, might prove to those
willing or desirous of obtaining information from what
has actually past, that the crisis of change is invariably
bad; and that objects, attained by the sacrifice of an existing
generation, have very frequently proved of less value than
those for which they had been substituted. Parties, from
their very natures, are known to run into extremes; it is
probable, therefore, that the leaders opposed to Mr. Pitt
professed much greater admiration of the new principles
than they really felt; such professions were, however,
made; and Sir Francis Basset concurring in opinion with
many of the wisest, the best informed, and of those most
deeply interested in the welfare of the country, that the
safety of the state was at issue, added his weight to what would
now be termed the Conservative scale.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Basset, so distinguished by personal qualities
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
and attainments, by the antiquity of his family, by the
achievements of his ancestors, and by fortune, had long
been designated in public opinion as a person proper to be
placed in the House of Peers; and accordingly, on the 17th
of July 1796, an hereditary seat in Parliament was bestowed
on him by the King, together with the nominal
Barony of Dunstanville, so called after Barons of that
name, in the time of Henry the First, Henry the Second,
Richard Cœur de Lion, John, and Henry the Third, who
were equally connected with his family and with the reigning
family of Plantagenet.</p>

<p>A second creation took place on the 7th of November
in the following year, of Baron Basset, with a special
remainder to his daughter in failure of male issue.</p>

<p>Lord Dunstanville has from this period continued to
support the genuine character of a dignified English gentleman;
discharging his parliamentary duties in the manner
deemed most useful to the interests of his country; executing
the office of a magistrate to the benefit, and to the
entire satisfaction, of his neighbourhood; setting an example
most worthy of general imitation, as the possessor of
an extensive landed estate, and as a most liberal proprietor
of mines. Kind and benevolent to every one, esteemed in
the highest degree by his private friends and relations, and
certainly placed by general acclamation, in regard to all
these qualities and circumstances taken together, as by far
the first man in the county which he has benefited and
adorned.</p>

<p>The Editor has written this imperfect and inadequate
sketch of Lord Dunstanville with a heavy heart; for
although his countenance brightens at the presence of a
friend, and memory still presents some images of things
past by, and reason continues to discriminate the ideas
brought into view, yet such are the ways of Providence,
leading, as we hope, believe, and trust to universal good,
that a wreck only remains of what used to excite our admiration,
our respect, and our esteem.</p>

<p>Lord Dunstanville married, May the 16th 1780, Frances
<!--254.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>

<p>This extensive parish resembles that of Camborne in its
geological structure. Its southern portion rests on granite,
which at Carnarthen abounds in shorl; and at Carnkie
it contains a bed of porphyry, with crystals of felspar and
of shorl; and at the same place another bed, the basis of
which more resembles compact shorl rock than it does compact
felspar. Near Portreath, and from thence to <a name="err11" id="err11"></a>Perth
Towan, the slate appears to differ from that of Camborne;
and at Perth Towan it contains short irregular veins of
calcareous spar, as at Porthalla in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevern, and at
other places on the borders of the calcareous series.</p>

situated partly in this parish and partly in Rume, and
feudatory to the manor of East Anthony, did belong to the
family of Eliot, by whom it was alienated in 1635 to
Richard Treville, merchant; and that from the Trevilles it
passed by coheiresses to the families of Cross and Trelawny.
The whole now belongs to Lord Graves, who has also the
manor of Withroe, called in this parish Winnow.</p>

<p>There hath been for many ages in Cornwall, a certain
sort of unlearned men called attornies, who have taken
upon them to solve all questions, debts, damages, and difficulties
whatsoever, by exciting or increasing them, under
pretence of friendship and good council, who are often
called upon to the assistance of men of lazy or weak understanding
to their undoing.</p>

<p>For instance thereof, I well remember in this parish of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Issey there had lived two brethren of the surname of
Warne, who having some small disputes or controversies
one with the other, not determined, concerning a tenement
of land in fee, containing about fifty acres, at a place
called &mdash;&mdash;; they appealed to two attornies, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Joseph
Hawkey, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, and Degory King, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock
in Pider, who run this their controversy so far in law and
equity, that they were not able to pay the cost thereof as
punctually as those attornies expected; thereupon they
<!--258.png--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
brought actions at law against their clients for the same,
and at length obliged the two brothers of the Warnes aforesaid,
to sell the inheritance of their lands aforesaid to their
attornies, the one half thereof to Hawkey and the other
moiety thereof to King, now in quiet possession thereof.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this parish will tell you by tradition,
that the tutelar guardian of this church is one <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giggy,
who in a place so called in this parish, hath yet extant a
walled consecrated well, or spring of water, where heretofore
he heard and judged cases of conscience for the cure
of souls; but all further history of him is wanting, save
that they tell me <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Issey is only a corruption of Giggy.</p>

the Fourth’s days one of the dwellings of the
Champernons, of Intsworth, near Saltash; and in this
place they had a great and magnificent house, as appears
from the walls and ruinous rubbish and downfalls
thereof yet to be seen, as also their domestic chapel and
burying place; in the glass windows of which chapel was
lately to be seen this inscription: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Orate pro anima Domini
Ricardi de Campo Arnulphi;”</span> and beneath the same
his paternal coat armour, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Gules, a saltire Varry, between
twelve cross-crosslets Or; which shews that he derived
his blood and bones from the Champernownes, of
Clyst Champernowne in Devon. For the Champernownes
of Umberleigh and North Taunton, near Modbury, gave
for their armes, the one Gules, a saltire Varry; the other,
Gules, a saltire Varry between twelve billets Argent. [The

Pendenis or Pendunes, the head fort, fortress, or fortified
place; probably from the little island here, containing
about six acres of ground, on which there stands the ruins
of a little old fortification and a chapel, betwixt which island
and the bending shore, or sea cliff, stands an indifferent
safe road for ships to lie at anchor with some winds, which
gives opportunity of trade and merchandize to the townsmen
(whose town is situate thereon) and also for fishing,
whereby they have much enriched themselves of late years.</p>

<p>Trenwith in this parish, was the voke lands of a considerable
manor, privileged with a court leet before the
Norman conquest, that heretofore extended itself over divers
parishes; for by that name it was taxed in Domesday
book, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, from which place was transnominated
an ancient family of gentlemen, now in possession
thereof, from that of Bayliff now to Trenwith, who have
flourished here in good fame and reputation beyond the
memory of man, since Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> The present possessor
is Thomas Trenwith, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Lanyon; and
giveth for his arms, Argent, on a bend cotised Sable, three
roses of the Field.</p>

<p>Those lands of Trenwith were of old pertaining to the
Earls or Kings of Cornwall, afterwards to the Kings of
England; and were held by the tenure of knight service by
such as possessed them, if not from King Arthur’s days, (see
Dundagall) yet from William the Conqueror’s, who, in
imitation of him, gave bartons, manors, fields, large territories
of land to his favourites, under the tenures of villeinage
and knight service in capite, by means of which
knight service those tenants were obliged to do him any
necessary service, either in wars or to his royal person, for
the performing whereof he took their oaths in public
courts, both of homage and fealty; and by reason of this
<!--264.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
tenure he disposed of the bodies of their heirs in marriage
as he listed, and retained in his custody and wardship their
whole inheritance till they accomplished the age of twenty-one
years; and by those examples other men of great possessions
did the like. Those lands of Trenwith, tempore
Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> were held by that tenure in capite by Edmund
Plantagenet, alias Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset, grandchild
to John Duke of Lancaster, 21 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> 1442, consisting
of four knights’ fees, 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> (See Carew’s
Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 39). He was slain at the battle of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s 1450, on the part of Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> against
Richard Duke of York; as also was his son Henry on the
same part after the battle of Hexham, and his brother Edmund
after Tewkesbury 1471, beheaded by King Edward
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> and his whole estate confiscated to the Crown; from
whence Bayliff, now Trenwith, purchased part of those
lands, which still pays high rent to the Kings of England.
In like manner Humphrey Plantagenet, fourth son of King
Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> held by the same tenure in Conerton, Binerton,
Drineck, and Ludgian, four knight’s fees of land in
those places. He was impeached of treason at the Parliament
held at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmund’s Bury in Suffolk; afterwards
murdered; and those and all other his lands confiscated.</p>

by our ancestors the Britons, before the church of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives was erected or endowed; betwixt which island and
the shore is an indifferent roadstead with some winds for
ships to lie at anchor.</p>

<p>This town is particularly famous for the art of catching
fish; in which trade or occupation of late they have been
attended with good success, to the great advancement of
their wealth and reputation. The chief inhabitants of
which place were Mr. Hitchins, Mr. Trevilion, Mr. Beare,

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives has grown, since the time of Mr. Carew, into a
place of considerable importance, participating in the general
prosperity of the whole country; and deriving great
local advantages from the extension of its fisheries, from the
construction of a pier, and from the extraordinary increase
of trade at the adjacent port of Hayle.</p>

<p>Fish of almost every kind, frequenting the coast of Cornwall,
are taken at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives; but the fishery absorbing all the
others in its magnitude is the taking of pilchards.</p>

<p>Pilchards are taken in two different ways quite distinct
from each other.</p>

<p>The first, most ancient, most certain, and therefore of
greatest importance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood,
is called drifting.</p>

<p>Boats sail in the open sea, drawing after them a great
number of nets appended to each other, provided with
small leads and corks at the opposite sides, and extending
in all to a very great length. The meshes of these nets
are made of such a size as to admit the head of a pilchard
<!--266.png--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
to pass through them, but not the body; in consequence
such fish as strike against the net are retained suspended by
their gills, acting in the nature of a barb.</p>

<p>The second method is on a much more extensive scale,
uncertain as to success; but occasionally giving fortunes to
those concerned in carrying it on, by the gain of one prosperous
year.</p>

<p>This method is founded entirely on the habit common
to all the clupea genus of congregating in large shoals, and
coming occasionally near the shore into shallow water, and
into places where the ground is free from rocks; this latter
circumstance is peculiarly favourable in the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives Bay,
and the ground is moreover covered to the depth of several
feet by a fine sand, composed entirely of shells, reduced
almost to a state of powder.</p>

<p>All the most favourable stations are occupied during the
proper season of the year by large boats, having nets on
board measuring four hundred and forty yards in length by
twenty-seven yards in breadth, capable therefore of covering
nearly two and an half statute acres. These nets are provided
with very heavy weights at one of their sides, so as to sink
them firmly on the ground, and with large corks to make
them buoyant on the other. Two large boats and one smaller,
as an attendant, are appropriated to each net; and when a
shoal is discovered approaching, by a well-known change of
colour and a ripple on the water, these boats, sometimes
directed also by signals from the shore, move in opposite
directions, extending the immense net to intercept the fish,
and then to close it behind them. In this way a quantity sufficient
to fill a thousand casks, after being pressed, have been
frequently secured at one time, and on some occasions much
more. The casks are hogsheads of fifty-four gallons, and
contain about two thousand five hundred pilchards, so that
the thousand hogsheads make two millions and a half
secured by one net.</p>

<p>The fish are taken out of the sea by raising them to the
surface of the water in smaller nets, used within the great
<!--267.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
net forming an artificial pond; and finally they are dipped
up in baskets. The first net, called a seyne, frequently
remaining in its original position for several days, or perhaps
gently slided towards the shore.</p>

<p>Pilchards are preserved for exportation in the following
manner: they are laid in regular heaps along the sides of
walls sheltered by roofs to a height easily reached, and to
a depth suited to the ordinary length of the arm, where
they are almost concealed by the great quantity of salt
strewed with them; three hundred and thirty-six pounds,
or three great hundred weight of salt, being allowed for
each pressed hogshead. In this state they remain thirty-six
days, while oil continually oozing from them is received
in pits; they are then rinced in water, and laid with great
care in casks made purposely with open joints, where they
receive a strong pressure through the medium of a long
beam and weights; more oil is then collected, and the casks,
closed up, are fitted for sale. Nine of these packages, independent
of the wood, are said to weigh two tons; so that
in their final state, the quantity of a thousand hogsheads,
not unfrequently caught at one time, must weigh above
two hundred and twenty tons.</p>

<p>The quantity of oil is very considerable, varying from
two to five gallons from each hogshead, but of inferior
quality. Pilchards thus cured are called fumados, which
seems to imply their having been originally smoked like
red herrings; their chief consumption takes place in Spain
and Italy.</p>

<p>The pilchards used for home consumption are invariably
picked; these are opened and washed, and then rubbed
with salt, about seven pounds to the hundred, and preserved
in jars or troughs.</p>

<p>The herring, pilchard, sprat, anchovy, and several other
species, are arranged by icthyologists under the genus
clupea; the herring and pilchard being adjacent to each
other. The pilchard is rather less in size than the herring,
has larger and firmer scales, and contains much more oil.
<!--268.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
There is one discriminating circumstance quite obvious;
the pilchard, suspended by its dorsal fin, remains in equilibrio,
while the herring, under similar circumstances, dips
towards its head.</p>

<p>The pier was built under the authority of an Act of Parliament
passed in the year 1767, after a personal survey
and a report from the celebrated Mr. Smeaton, which is
printed in his works. This shelter from every wind has
equally tended to improve the fishery, to increase the
general trade of the place, and to protect vessels bound for
Hayle; but the fishery is indebted in a still greater degree
to another Act of Parliament, carried through the legislature
by the late Mr. Humphry Mackworth Praed, who
had the honour first of representing this place, and then
the county.</p>

<p>A <a name="custom" id="custom"></a>caution had existed time of mind, by which any boat
provided with a seyne net, having taken possession of one
of the favourable stations or stems, might retain it till the
net had been used to inclose a shoal, or, according to the
technical expression, had been shot; and this right extended
from one season to another: persons in possession
of a stem were therefore unwilling to lose it, except for a
considerable prize, and small shoals were generally allowed
to escape. By Mr. Praed’s Act, so great and so beneficial
a change was made, that, arranging the succession in an
equitable manner, it allowed each boat to hold its stem but
for twenty-four hours, and consequently every shoal, however
small, was eagerly secured.</p>

<p>The nets are preserved for a long succession of years by
steeping them in a decoction of oak bark as frequently as
they are used; and, what would scarcely have been expected,
the fish oil without this preservative, would destroy
the twine in a very short time.</p>

<p>It seems that these nets must have been originally introduced
from Dungarvon in Ireland, since they are still said
to be braided according to the Dungarvon mesh, but no
similar fishery is remembered at that place. Fish, however,
<!--269.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
of all kinds not only migrate through distant seas,
but without any known cause, frequently leave one part
of a coast and resort to another, returning after uncertain
intervals to their former haunts.</p>

<p>There is one custom at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, of which the origin and
specific meaning are entirely lost. So soon as shoals of
pilchards are discovered in the bay, all the people, and more
especially the children, run round the town shouting,
<span class="sc">Heva! Heva!</span> with all their might.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives was distinguished in the last century by the
birth and residence for some years of a very eminent scholar,
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Jonathan Toup. His father, who died in
1721, was lecturer of that Town, as the church being a
daughter church to Lelant, is entitled to service from
the vicar only once in three weeks; his mother was the
heiress of the family of Busvargus, long settled at Busvargus
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just.</p>

<p>He was born in 1713; and it is apprehended received
the rudiments of classical learning from his father. He
became a Commoner of Exeter College, Oxford, and
having taken the usual degree of Bachelor of Arts, obtained
Holy Orders in 1736. He was Curate of Philleigh in
that year, and of Burian in 1738. He continued to pursue,
with extraordinary diligence, the study of Greek. He
became Rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s, near Looe in 1750, through
some private interest; but the Vicarage of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Merran
and a Prebend in the Cathedral of Exeter in 1774, were
procured from the Bishop of Exeter by his literary friend
Doctor William Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester.</p>

<p>Mr. Toup took his Master of Arts degree at Cambridge
in 1756, when he had advanced towards the middle of life,
and apparently as a qualification for his second living.</p>

<p>His chief work is, perhaps, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Emendationes in Suidam;
in quibus plurima loca Veterum Græcorum, Sophoclis et
Aristophanis in primis, tum explicuntur tum emaculantur.”</span>
These were printed in three parts, which came out in
three volumes in the years 1760, 1764, and 1766; and
<!--270.png--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
were followed in 1775 by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Appendiculum Notarum in Suidam.”</span>
All these have since been reprinted at Leipsic in
four volumes octavo; and the whole has been recently incorporated
into a most splendid and learned edition of
Kusterus’ Suidas, by the very Reverend Thomas Gaisford,
D.D., Dean of Christ Church, and Regius Professor of
Greek in the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>Mr. Toup gave also to the world by far the best edition
that has appeared of Longinus. He also assisted the celebrated
Mr. Thomas Warton in his edition of Theocritus;
and added, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Curæ posteriores, sive Appendicula Notarum
atque Emendationum in Theocritum, Oxonii nuperrime
publicatum.”</span> He also published a letter to Bishop Warburton
under the title of, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Epistola Critica ad Virum celeberrimum
Gulielmum (Warburton) Episcopum Glocestriensem.”</span></p>

<p>Nothing in particular is remembered of Mr. Toup’s
private life. He died unmarried at the Rectory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin’s in 1785; and the delegates of the Oxford press,
in regard for so eminent a scholar, and in return for a present
of <abbr title="manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> made by his niece and executrix, have erected
a monument to his memory in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s Church.</p>

<p>Another gentleman, although not a native of the town,
may be noticed here.</p>

<p>Mr. John Knill was born in the eastern part of Cornwall,
and served his clerkship as an attorney in Penzance,
from thence he removed to the office of a London attorney,
where having distinguished himself by application and intelligence,
he was recommended to the Earl of Buckinghamshire,
who at that time held the political interest of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives, to be his local agent.</p>

<p>After residing for some time at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, Mr. Knill was
sent on a mission to the West Indies, highly honourable to
his abilities and to his character, with an authority for inspecting
all the custom-houses and their establishments;
and, if sufficient cause should appear, with power to suspend
any one, however high, from his office.</p>

<p><!--271.png--><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
Having executed the functions thus delegated with integrity
and moderation, he returned to the collectorship at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and engaged in a very anomalous undertaking,
at that time sanctioned and encouraged by the government,
which consisted in equipping small vessels to act as priviateers
against smugglers. In this species of warfare he is
said to have been very successful; and on the breaking out
of the Dutch war in the war with America, these vessels
were ready to act their part in a practice most disgraceful
to a civilized nation, and which every good, honourable,
and humane man must hope will never again be repeated.
In this way vessels laden with private property, wholly unprepared
for resistance, utterly unacquainted with the
nations being at war, were plundered and robbed of whatever
they contained, and unoffending passengers were exposed
to insult and violence.</p>

<p>Mr. Knill was hurried by the force of circumstances,
contrary to his inclination and habits, and to his deep subsequent
regret, into doing what others did, and participating
in these unhallowed gains. The Editor understands,
however, that he showed every kindness in his power to
some objects of compassion who were made prisoners; and
that he restored several articles of their more valued property
at his own individual loss.</p>

<p>Soon after this time Mr. Knill took up the singular
fancy of erecting a triangular pyramid on a hill overlooking
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, with the intention of his being buried in a
proper receptacle hollowed in the base; and he invested a
sum of money in trust for the support of some half ludicrous
and half serious dances and processions, to be repeated
every fifth year.</p>

<p>He however, removed, to London, resided in Gray’s Inn,
was called to the bar, and became a bencher; and having departed
this life on the 29th of March 1811, was buried, by the
direction of his last will, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew’s church, Holborn.
The monument is ornamental to the country: on one side
of the pyramid are inscribed the words, “John Knill;” on a
<!--272.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
second, “I know that my Redeemer liveth;” and on the
third the word “Resurgam.”</p>

<p>The monument stands on the Editor’s land, and pays
him sixpence a-year, secured on a farm of some value, with
a power of distress.</p>

<p>Mr. Knill was undoubtedly a man of considerable talent.
When the Earl of Buckinghamshire took the office of
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, he selected Mr. Knill for
his private secretary; but not liking the bustle, nor perhaps
the responsibility of this situation, he returned to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives.
His philanthropy and general kindness were known to all;
but a variety of idle fancies and singularities, unworthy of
his talents and experience in the world, are remembered,
while the estimable qualities of his heart are perhaps forgotten.</p>

<p>An extraordinary event took place at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives on the
17th of Feb. 1780.</p>

<p>Some time in the month of December preceding, a large
body of troops had been embarked at New York for the
attack on Charlestown in South Carolina; and in a public
dispatch from Gen. Sir Henry Clinton, dated March the
9th, he says, “only one ship is missing, having on board a
detachment of Hessians; and supposed to have borne away
for the West Indies.” The Editor has ascertained by particular
inquiries, that the vessel alluded to in this dispatch
nearly reached Charlestown, the place of its destination, having
about two hundred and fifty German soldiers on board
with provision suited to so short a voyage, when being run
foul of by a ship of war in a gale of wind, and injured in the
masts and bowsprit, the vessel could sail no other way than
before the westerly wind, then blowing with violence; most
fortunately the direction of the wind continued steadily in
the same direction, and the passengers arrived safe, but
nearly famished, at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives on the day above-mentioned. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives and the neighbourhood contended with each other in
efforts, not merely to relieve the distress of these unfortunate
persons, but to make them comfortable and happy;
<!--273.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
the best attainable lodgings were provided for the private
men, and the officers were daily invited to gentlemen’s
houses. Their sufferings as foreigners on behalf of England,
had excited general compassion, heightened by the
reflection that they were not engaged in maintaining any
cause in which their country had an interest, that they were
not volunteers, but had been purchased by this nation from
an individual entrusted with unlimited power, for the good
of a portion of mankind, which he had most basely abused
for the sake of private gain, in a manner that must commit
his name and memory to infamy, and to the execration of
mankind; nor can the administration be freed from blame
that hired these human beings at so much a-day, and
agreed to give the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel a certain sum
for every one killed, or missing, or lamed.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin have enumerated several
names of families at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. In recent times, that of Stephens
has acquired an undisputed superiority.</p>

<p>That family, although merchants up to the decease of Mr.
John Stephens in 1764, had been long in possession of
landed property in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives; and the Editor has seen the
original of the following receipt given at the accession of
King James the First.</p>

<p class="sigright">

<p>Mr. John Stephens married Mary, one of the three
daughters of Mr. Samuel Phillips, of Pendrea in Gulval.</p>

<p>This gentleman appears to have been very successful in
his various concerns of merchandise and fisheries, as he
<!--274.png--><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
added largely to his landed property by purchases in the
immediate neighbourhood of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and also in the
parishes of Newlyn and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Enoder. He acted for many years
as agent to the Earl of Buckinghamshire in managing the
political concerns of the town; but at last broke off the
connection by getting his son, Mr. Samuel Stephens,
returned on a vacancy.</p>

<p>Mr. John Stephens had a numerous family; his eldest
son went to Holland, according to the practice of those
times, with the view of continuing his father’s mercantile
concerns; and the next son, Samuel, became a member of
the University of Cambridge to prepare himself for the
church, and probably with the expectation of obtaining
Lelant and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, but the death of his elder brother
caused this to be relinquished. He married Anne, daughter
of Mr. Seaborn, of Bristol; and on his father’s decease
about the year 1764, he disposed of every thing connected
with the trade and fishery of this place, and having
abandoned the sect of Presbyterians, to which all his
family and relations had been strongly attached, he went so
far as to pull down the meeting-house, and to withdraw his
support from its minister; proceedings well remembered
to his disadvantage on subsequent occasions.</p>

<p>About the year 1774, Mr. Stephens commenced building
his new house at Tregonna; and in that and in a subsequent
year proved unsuccessful at a poll, and on a petition,
for the representation of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. He died in March
1794, leaving three sons, John Stephens, Rector of Ludgvan;
Samuel, to whom he devised a large portion of his
estate; and Augustus, all of whom have died in the present
year (1834); also three daughters, Anne, Maria,
and Harriet. Mr. Samuel Stephens, the second son, married
Betty, sole daughter of Capt. Wallis, the discoverer of
Otaheite, and coheiress of the families of Hearle and Paynter.
He represented <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives in two Parliaments, and died
February the 25th, 1834, leaving five sons, and one daughter,
married to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles William Davy.</p>

Previously to the Act of Parliament of 1832, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives
sent two Members to Parliament; and the right of voting
rested in persons paying scot and lot throughout the
parish. It now sends one member in conjunction with
Lelant and Towednack. The present representative is
Mr. James Halse, probably related to the historian: this
gentleman is among the most enterprising and successful
adventurers in mines of the present day.</p>

<p>The situation of the town would seem to be most salubrious,
and perhaps it is so in ordinary times; but few
places have suffered more from occasional epidemics.</p>

<p>The Editor remembers to have heard dreadful traditionary
accounts of the plague in 1647. No market was
kept in the town for a considerable space of time; but
instead of it, supplies were brought to the edge of two
streams of water at Polmanter and at Longstone Downs,
where provisions were deposited with their prices affixed,
which the inhabitants took away, leaving their money in
the streams. It it said, however, that the Stephens family
having retired to a farm called Aire, which they possessed
just out of the town, and having there cut off all communication
with others, entirely escaped, although 535 died in
the course of one summer, out of a population which could
not at that period have exceeded treble the amount. In
the spring of 1786, a fever raged with great violence, to
which the reverend Mr. Lane, then lecturer, and Mrs.
Lane fell victims within a few days of each other.</p>

<p>The whole inscription on the cup given by Sir Francis
Basset is as follows:</p>

<p>The arms of the town are, Argent, an ivy bush overspreading
the whole field Proper, evidently in allusion to
<!--276.png--><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
the name; but this bearing has afforded an obvious joke
throughout the neighbouring parishes at the expense of
the Mayor.</p>

<p>The church is unusually large and handsome, with a
fourth aile at the eastern end, and a lofty tower; and few
prospects are equally beautiful with that of the town and
bay from the hill near Tregenna.</p>

<p>The parish feast is celebrated at the same time as that
of Lelant the mother church; and Lelant, Redruth, and
Crowan, are said to honour <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eury by holding their feasts
on the nearest Sunday to her day, February 1st, but no
trace of any such saint can be found.</p>

<p>The parish measures 1524 statute acres.</p>

<p>This parish is a donative, the patrons Sir John Molesworth

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker agrees in assigning to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Juliet the honour

<p>There seems to be some confusion in Mr. Hals’ narrative
<!--278.png--><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
between the appropriations of the Rectory and of the
Vicarage, which Mr. Whitaker endeavours to explain in
the following note.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Mr. Hals has confounded himself by the identity of
names. The Rectory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julyot is placed by the first
Valor in the Deanery of Trig <em>Minor</em>, and the <em>Chapel</em> of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julyot is placed by it; and by the second in that of Trig
<em>Major</em>. The former too is rated so high as 12<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, while the
latter is only 26<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> even at a period so much later. The
former therefore is the only large living of Trig Minor
that is unnoticed in the first Valor, Lanteglos, correspondently
valued in the second at 34<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 11<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 3<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> And the
latter is the present <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julyot, not a Rectory, but a mere
Chapel in the first Valor, a mere Curacy Parochial in the
second, once appropriated to the Abbey of Tavistock, and
therefore having only 15<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> certified value at present, the
old allocation settled upon it by the Abbey.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has given a very long history of Julius, Pope
or Bishop of Rome, from the year 343 to 358, which is
omitted.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything worth relating in the history or
legend of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julyot. She is said to have suffered death,
having been accused by a violent and wicked person who
had previously taken from her by force some ample possessions.
There is extant a sermon of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Basil in praise
of this saint, who is commemorated in the Rituale Romanum
on the 30th of July.</p>

<p>The family of Rawle, settled for some time at Leskeard,
are said to have originated from Hennot, in this parish.
They, together with Molesworth of Pencarrow, are joint
impropriators, and alternately nominate the perpetual
curate.</p>

Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, 1535, this Castle and the land whereon it
stands, together with the government thereof, as I am informed,
was given by that King to Sir Robert Le Greice,
Knight, an Arragonist or Spaniard, whose son, in Queen
Elizabeth’s reign, sold the inheritance thereof to Hanniball
Vyvyan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Trelowarren, who thereupon was made
Governor thereof; as some say after his decease, Sir
Francis Vyvyan, Knight, his son; after his decease Sir
Richard Vyvyan, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>, his son; after his decease Sir Vyell
Vyvyan, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>, who was so far imposed upon by John Earl

of the lands whereon this Castle stands, to him for
500<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; who forthwith transferred it over to Sir Joseph

thereof given to his Privy Councellor, the Right
Honourable Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, now in possession

<p>There was a great controversy in Parliament, 4 James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>,

<p>During the interregnum of Cromwell, Sir Richard Vyvyan,
as a person dissaffected to his government, was displaced
from the gubernation of this Castle, and one Captain Rouse
put in his place, which gentleman, as I have been informed,
before the war broke out between King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and his
Parliament, was of such low fortune in the world that he
lived in a barn at Landrake, and lodged on straw, till he
got a commission to be a Captain in the Parliament Army
under the Earl of Essex, which brought him into money
and credit; so that at length he was posted the Commander
or Governor of this Castle, who behaved himself so very
proud, grand, severe, and magisterial towards the neighbouring
<!--282.png--><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
gentlemen of the royal party, that it gave occasion to
John Trefusis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, to make this short description of him
in verse; which the Cavalier party, when they met to drink
the King’s health, would commonly sing in derision of the
Governor, and called it their passado, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:</p>

<p>Part of this barn aforesaid, tempore William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, as I
am informed, was converted to a dwelling house, the other
part was made a Presbyterian meeting-house, by Mr.
Robert Rouse of Wootton, son of the gentleman before
mentioned, who with his family commonly on Sundays
met there with great numbers of people of that profession,
to hear the predicaments of their Priest. This Mr. Robert
Rouse married Harrington of Somersetshire, and resided
there during his father, the Governor, Rouse’s life, with his
wife, during which stay there he had by her one or two
sons; and after his father’s death, he came down to Wootton
in this county.</p>

Tolvern, but as the capital place is in Philly I shall there

<p>Treveres; the town in the ways or roads, veres being
the plural of ver or vere, a road, way or lane.</p>

<p>This place has been for several generations, by lease
from the Arundells and the succeeding lords of Tolvern,
the seat of the Jacks, the last of whom, Richard Jack, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
dying without issue, left this estate to his sister’s only
daughter, heiress of William Hooker, of Trelisick, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

<p>Near this place lies Rosecossa, the woody valley, which
I am told was formerly the seat of Sir John Rosecossa, who
had here a large house and a chapel, but lately demolished.
He left two daughters coheiresses, married to Trefry and
Woollcumbe. This estate, with another called Tolcarne,

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has given a long history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, the companion
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin, and his successor in the See of Canterbury,
all of which is omitted. The parish is supposed
to be under the patronage of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, or Justus Archbishop
of Lyons, about the year 350. This Saint, already a
Bishop, began his career towards beatitude, by assisting
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ambrose in his furious hostility against the Arians, and
completed it by retiring into the deserts of Egypt, to prepare
himself for the society of superior beings, through
the favour of Him who is the author of all wisdom, of all
knowledge, and of all benevolence, to be obtained by
discarding or stupefying in solitude every kind affection,
and every faculty of intelligence bestowed on him by the
Almighty.</p>

<p>He is commemorated in the Roman Calendar on the
second of September.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes and its castle are by far the objects of greatest
curiosity in this parish.</p>

<p><!--284.png--><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
The shelter afforded for boats must at all times have
rendered this place a resort of fishermen, but it acquired
more importance and a name by the residence of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mawes, who seems to have come from Ireland with the
other missionaries.</p>

<p>Accounts respecting him are extremely various. Some
assimilate his history to that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, stating that he
attained the episcopal dignity, and then, in compliance
with the taste of that age, retired to an ascetic solitude;
other legends represent him as a schoolmaster, and in early
paintings he may be seen with the well-known emblem of
scholastic authority in his hand.</p>

<p>The castle at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes was undoubtedly built by King
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> but a tradition universally believed in Cornwall
is much less certain.</p>

<p>It is said that the King came to view the situation of
his two projected castles of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes and Pendennis; that
he passed two nights at Tolvorn, then a seat of the Arundells;
and that he crossed the river from thence to Feock,
at a passage that has ever since gone by his name. There
is not, however, any trace of this journey to be found in
histories of the times, nor in any public document.</p>

<p>The privilege of sending Members to Parliament was
given to this village by Queen Elizabeth, in pursuance,
probably, of the Tudor policy noticed under Michell; and
if the creation of a close borough were the object really
intended, it proved invariably successful up to the general
disfranchisement of 1832.</p>

<p>This right of sending Members to Parliament, accompanied
by the pageantry of maces and sergeants-at-arms,
and combined with various personal advantages, could
not fail of exciting feelings of envy and ridicule. In this
instance the village of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes, extending in a single
line of houses in the direction of the beach, has readily
presented a topic, which was, to inquire whether the new
mayor lived on the same side of the street as his predecessor.</p>

On the south side of this parish, upon a lofty hill, stands
Chapel Carne Bray, that is to say Bray’s spar-stone Chapel,
and suitable to its name it is situate upon the top of the
most astonishing burrow or tumulus of Carnes, or spar
stones, that ever my eyes beheld; artificially laid together
perhaps upon the bodies of human creatures, interred upon
the mountain before the fifth century; on the top of which
burrow of stones, which is about fifteen feet high from the
ground, stands the chapel itself; which riseth about ten
feet higher, well built with moor-stone and lime, with a
window in the east, and a durns, or door, on the south of
the same stones; the roof all well covered or arched over
with large flat moor-stones, wrought with the hammer and
strongly fastened together. The chapel being about ten
feet broad and about fourteen feet long (as that on Roach
Rock) on the outside; and round this chapel may be seen,
the downfalls of many sparstone-stairs and walks, by which
heretofore the people ascended to this chapel, and diverted
themselves with a full prospect of the contiguous country
by sea and land&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Channel, the British Ocean,
and the Atlantic Sea towards the Scilly Islands, of which
from hence in fair weather you may have a full view; which
lands of Scilly seem to stand in equal height with this
chapel, though the ground towards the Land’s End, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
<a name="err13" id="err13"></a>Leucan and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lennan, on the sea-shore towards it, are at
least eighty fathoms lower, or under it, as is the sea itself,
betwixt that and the Scilly Islands. Such another chapel
as this, though not built upon a burrow of stones, is to be
seen on Mountague Hill, in Somersetshire, and dedicated
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael the Archangel, for half a mile ascended up
the hill upon stone stairs, embowed or arched over head
right artificially. (See also Camden in Somerset.) Thus it
appears that this tribe of Bray were heretofore men of great
wealth, fame, and renown in those parts; since their name
adheres not only to two local places in this parish, but
divers others, as Castle Carne Bray in Luggan, Bray in
Morvall, and many other places.</p>

<p><!--288.png--><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
In this parish also was formerly <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewny’s Chapel,
now dilapidated; see Redruth and Lelant for more of this
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewny.</p>

<p>Those spar-stone monuments of Carne Bray Castle, and
Chapel Carne Bray aforesaid, will I suppose perpetuate
the name and memory of those Brays till the final consummation
of all things, as aforesaid. Bray, in Battle
Abbey Roll, is recorded to have come into England with
William the Conqueror; but by the names of those local
places and the fabrics aforesaid, it is probable they were
here long before.</p>

<p>In this parish is a large flat stone, on which, as tradition
says, seven Saxon Kings at one time and day,
dined thereon, at such time as they came into Cornwall to
see the Land’s End thereof, and of Great Britain; which
Kings are said to have been: 1. Ethelbert, 5th King of
Kent; 2. Cissa, 2nd King of the South Saxons; 3. Kingills,
6th King of the West Saxons; 4. Sebert, <abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> King of the
East Saxons; 5. Ethelfred, 7th King of the Northumbers;
6. Penda, 5th King of the Mercians; and 7. Sigebert, 5th
King of the East Angles; who all flourished about the
year 600, and were all crowned heads, as Samuel Daniell
in his Chronicle tells us.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span></p>

full account of it.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Pendeen claims the first attention of any place in this
parish. It was for some ages the residences of the Borlases,
<!--289.png--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
since removed to Castle Horneck, near Penzance.
At Pendeen resided in the early part of his life Mr. John
Borlase, sometime member for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. Here were born
his two sons the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Walter Borlase, <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr> Vice Warden
of the Stannaries; and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Borlase, <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr>
by diploma from the university of Oxford, the justly celebrated
writer of the Antiquities and of the Natural History
of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Pendeen exhibits an excellent specimen of the large but
comfortless houses, inhabited by gentlemen two centuries
ago.</p>

<p>Near the house may be seen one of those very ancient
excavations called vaus or faus. See Borlase’s Antiquities,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 293, <abbr title="second edition">2d. edit.</abbr> 1769. They are conjectured to have been
made for places of refuge in times when predatory descents
on the coast were of frequent occurrence, and always causes
of alarm. Yet the entrance could not be concealed, and
the five kings of the Amorites had left an example, confirmed
at no remote period by the cruel fate of a northern
clan, proving the utter insecurity of such a retreat.</p>

<p>On the sea-shore below the house is a small cove, where
boats and nets are kept for fishing; but so small is the
shelter on this iron-bound coast, that the boats are drawn
up by ropes or chains, and kept suspended during the
winter, on the sloping surface of a steep cliff.</p>

<p>Some miles westward of Pendeen, and near the sea, is
Botallock, the seat of the Usticks; one among the many
families that resided for centuries in this remote peninsula,
moderately endowed with gifts of fortune, but possessed of
the honour and feelings of gentlemen.</p>

<p>This parish has been productive of tin from the most
early periods; and Botallock would have elevated its proprietors
in the scale of wealth, but times and manners had
changed, so that the last Mr. Ustick of that place having
spent his estate, and then got it redeemed by a productive
mine, sold it at last to Admiral Boscawen, to whose grandson
the property now belongs. The veins or lodes of tin
<!--290.png--><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
having been wrought within the last fifty years to depths
unattainable before the introduction of improved steam-engines,
copper has, in very many instances, been found
under the tin; and this has occurred at Botallock, where
situated on the edge of a cliff, the workings with the steam-engines,
whims, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> present a spectacle more unique and
more imposing than any other in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Further from the shore is Busvargus, the seat of an
ancient family of the same name, the heiress of which was
the mother of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Jonathan Toup, whose eminence as
a scholar has been noticed under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. He died without
issue in 1785; and the estate of Busvargus, having
been settled on the children of his half-sister, is now the
property of his niece, Mrs. Nicholas of Looe, the present
representative of the Busvargus family.</p>

<p>The families of most distinction in latter times, inhabitants
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, were Allan and Moddern, but both names
are now extinct.</p>

<p>The great tithes appertained to the monastery of Glaseney,
in Penryn. They now belong to Borlase.</p>

<p>The vicarage is in the presentation of the crown, and was
held for many years by Doctor William Borlase, the historian.</p>

<p>And here perhaps the Editor may be allowed to mention
the name of one whom he esteemed and admired, although
his connection with Cornwall was so little permanent as to
consist only of his serving the curacy of this parish.</p>

<p>The Reverend John Smyth, Fellow of Pembroke College,
Oxford, received his title for deacon’s orders from
Doctor William Borlase, as vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, where he remained
about six or seven years, till Cornwall lost one of
its greatest ornaments.</p>

<p>Leaving <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, after Doctor Borlase’s decease, he became
the friend and assistant of the Reverend Sir Richard
Kaye, Dean of Lincoln, and through his recommendation
made the tour of Europe with Mr. Langley, a gentleman of
Yorkshire. He then went back to College, and on a vacancy
<!--291.png--><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
became tutor, and succeeded to the Headship; returning
from a visit to Penzance, in 1809, he died in consequence
of some local complaint at Exeter, where a monument
has been placed to his memory in the Cathedral
Church, with the following inscription:</p>

<p class="unindent center" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juxta conditur<br />
Joannes Smyth, S. T. P.<br />
Magister Collegii Pembrochiæ<br />
apud Oxonienses,<br />

hoc marmor posuêre<br />
Successor ejus et Socii.</p>

<p>There is also a cenotaph in the Cathedral at Gloucester,
a prebend of which church is annexed to the mastership of
Pembroke College, by the liberality of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>Few men were ever more universally esteemed, or were
more deserving of being so. His abilities and learning
commanded respect; kindness, generosity, and benevolence
endeared him to every friend; whilst good nature and convivial
manners made him the favorite of each casual acquaintance.</p>

<p>To him the Editor is indebted for his good fortune in
being himself a member of Pembroke College.</p>

<p>The parish feast is celebrated on the Sunday nearest to
All Saints, November the first; but the church is known
to claim for its patron <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, the companion of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin,
Bishop of Rochester, and afterwards Archbishop of
Canterbury. Little is handed down to posterity of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Just, but that little is entirely to his praise; at the command
of Pope Gregory the Great, he undertook the
perilous but successful service of converting the English
Saxons; he attained the highest ecclesiastical dignity
from the suffrages of those who had been brought by the
<!--292.png--><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
labours of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin and of his followers, within the pale of
the church; and he obtained deserved commendation from
Pope Boniface, either the third or fourth, who with one
intermediate Pope, were the successors of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gregory,
when the apostolic confirmation of his appointment to the
metropolitan see was given, and himself honoured by the
investure of a pall. He is stated in the Rubrics to have
died on the 10th of November in the year 627.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to be more obvious, or to be more congenial
to the human mind, than an annual celebration of
particular events. Nature has completed in twelve months
the most distinctly marked of her cycles. The seasons
are renewed in the same order; and, if experience did not
soon convince us of the contrary, we might be induced to
think that our own existence in this world was destined to
tread the same perpetual round.</p>

<p>Birth-days appear to have been celebrated in honour of
living persons from times the most remote, either by nations,
provinces, or private families, in proportion as their claims
to attention were more or less wide. After the decease of
those who have been supposed to confer benefits on mankind,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo,”</span> and
more especially of those to whom nations owed their spiritual
light and hopes, the days of such persons leaving this
scene of trial, of sorrow, of anxiety, and of disappointment,
to obtain their reward in Heaven, became epochs
for uniting religious observance with joy and gladness.
Churches were, therefore, dedicated to their memories and
festivals instituted; but in England at least this instinctive
propensity received the aid of a policy similar to that which,
in still earlier periods, had fixed the Christian festivals on the
very days previously occupied by the celebration of ancient
superstition. Bede has preserved the following letter from
Pope Gregory to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mellitus, who led a second band of
missionaries into England, after the successful preaching of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin, and became the first Bishop of London, where he
is said to have founded the two Cathedrals, and finally to
have attained the Archbishopric of Canterbury.</p>

<p>This parish, with the exception of a narrow band of slate
which skirts the coast from Pendeen Cove to Cape Cornwall,
is situated entirely on granite. It has been long celebrated
for its mines, which generally are placed on or near
<!--295.png--><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
to the junction of the granite and the slate; and in consequence
of the narrow limits of the latter rock, their workings
often extend under the sea. Botallack mine is a noted
instance of this description; and its steam engine and machinery,
perched on the side of a steep rocky cliff, present
one of the most picturesque objects in the country. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Just has afforded specimens of by far the greater number
of British minerals. Its slate has a basis of compact felspar,
and exhibits many interesting varieties of this rock;
but the most rare is that which abounds with disseminated
garnets at Botallack. The principal lodes of this parish
exhibit some peculiarities in their direction, and the little

the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kain.</p>

<p>The presidual guardian of this church is one of those two
holy women mentioned by writers as famous for their piety
and supernatural facts; the one of the British blood, the
other of Saxon race. That of the British is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kayne,
daughter of Braghan, king and builder of the town of
Brecknock in Wales, who flourished about the year 500;
the which King Braghan had issue also twenty-three other
daughters, all for the like reasons aforesaid entered into the
catalogue or calendar of saints; and also two sons, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Canock
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Caddock, to whose honour and memory a
chapel in Padstow parish was erected; and still, though
disused from divine service, bearing his name. The other
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kayne was born about the seventh century, upon the
river Avon in Somersetshire, at a place which after her
decease sprung up a town, still flourishing in fame and
wealth, from her denominated Kainsham, i. e. Kain’s house,
home, habitation, or dwelling. She is famous amongst
agonal writers for miracle working, particularly for turning
serpents into stones wheresoever she saw them, so that
they had not power either to hurt man or beast; a woman
very much wanted now in Cornwall, where adders or serpents
abound to the great hurt of man and beast.</p>

<p>She is also highly praised by John Capgrave in his
book of the English Saints, for her purity, piety, and
chastity.</p>

<p>To one of these two women is also dedicated the vicarage
church of Cainham, in Holderness hundred in York;
as also Caynham vicarage church in Ludlow hundred in
Salop.</p>

<p>In this parish at &mdash;&mdash; lived some of the Coplestons
of Colbrook in Devon, as I take it; which place descended
to them by some of the heirs of Flemmen, Berkley, Turvey,
Courtney, Bonvill, Pawlet, Chichester, Bridges, Graas,
Hawley, Huish, Wiedbury, Fitzwalter, or some others,
which they married with successively; and thereby obtained
<!--297.png--><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">293</span>
such a mighty estate in Cornwall and Devon that they were
generally distinguished by the name of the “great Coplestons.”
But, alas! maugre all their great riches and wealth,
the last John Great Coplestone, tempore Elizabeth, for killing
his natural son and godson in discontent, was indicted at
the assizes at Exeter, tried and found guilty of wilful murder,
and sentenced to death for the same; and lay in gaol
till he sold thirteen manors of land in Cornwall to obtain
a reprieve or pardon; and left of legal issue only one son,
named John, who had issue only two daughters that became
his heirs; married to Bamphield and Elford, in whom the
estate, name, and blood of those Coplestons is terminated,
who gave for their arms, Argent, a chevron Gules, between
three leopards’ faces Azure. These gentlemen were
hereditary esquires of the white spur, who, together with
the Champernowns and the Carmenows, possessed and enjoyed
the profits of their private estates in Devon and Cornwall,
to that great degree, in former ages, that the like great
riches was not then to be found in any other family for
value in those counties, though now I know not of any
lands in Cornwall remaining in those tribes, or any of those
names now extant there.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Camden, in Somersetshire, mentions Keine as a devout
British Virgin, whom many of the last age, through an
over credulous temper, believed to have changed serpents
into stones, because they find sometimes in quarries some
such little miracles of sporting nature. She is said to have
been born on the banks of the river Avon in that county,
at the place where after her decease sprung up a town, from
her denominated Keynesham. She is famous among the
agonal writers for her purity, piety, and charity, as also for
many miracles, particularly for turning serpents into stones.</p>

<p>There was one other <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keyne famous among the Britains
of Wales, daughter to Brechanus, King, and namer
<!--298.png--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
of Brecknock Town. He had twenty-four daughters and
two sons, all Saints.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that both these <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keynes may
be one and the same.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that the ancient name of this parish
was Lametton, and that the manor still exists.</p>

<p>This manor he further states was the property of Sir
Robert Tresilian, Lord Chief Justice of the King’s Bench,
attainted in the reign of King Richard the Second, by
whom this portion of his property was bestowed on John
Hawley, of Dartmouth, supposed to have married a daughter
of the Chief Justice. His daughter and heiress brought
it to the Coplestones.</p>

<p>In the reign of James the First it belonged to the Harrisons
of Mount Radford in Devonshire, and from them it
passed by marriage to the Rashleighs.</p>

<p>Mr. William Rashleigh, of Menabilly, is now the proprietor
of the whole or nearly the whole of this parish,
and in it of the celebrated well, which Mr. Carew notices
in the following manner, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 305, Lord Dunstanville’s <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr></p>

<p>“Next I will relate to you another of the Cornish natural
wonders, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Saint Keyne’s Well; but lest you make
wonder, first at the Saint before you notice the well, you
must understand that this was not Kayne the Manqueller,
but one of a gentler spirit and milder sex, to wit, a woman.
He who caused the spring to be pictured added this
rhyme for an explanation:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">In name, in shape, in quality,</div>
  <div class="i2">This Well is very quaint;</div>
  <div class="i0">The name to lot of Kayne befell,</div>

  <div class="i2">Withy, oak, elm, and ash,</div>

  <div class="i2">Whose chance or choice attains,</div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Tonkin quotes this passage from Carew, and adds:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Did it retain this wondrous quality, as it does to this
day the shape, I believe there would be to it a greater
resort of both sexes than either to Bath or Tunbridge; for
who would not be fond of attaining this longed-for sovereignty?”
And Mr. Tonkin adds further, “since the
writing of this the trees were blown down by a violent
storm; and in their place Mr. Rashleigh, in whose land
it is, has planted two oaks, an ash, and an elm, which thrive
very well; but the wonderful arch is destroyed.”</p>

<p>For a most interesting account of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keyne’s Well, and
of all that portion of Cornwall, the reader is referred to
Mr. Bond’s “Topographical and Historical Sketches of
East and West Looe, and of the Neighbourhood,” 1 <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr>
8vo. 1823, printed by John Nichols and Son, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 25, Parliament
Street, Westminster.</p>

<p>Mr. Bond says that the trees were blown down by the
great storm of November 1703, and that Mr. Philip Rashleigh,
who succeeded his father in the property about that
time, planted soon afterwards the trees which have now
acquired their full growth, and probably equalled those
which stood there before them.</p>

<p>Mr. Bond has also printed the beautiful as well as humorous
lines composed by Mr. Southey, and referred to
other verses on the same subject in the Gentleman’s Magazine
for June 1822, <abbr title="volume 92, one page">vol. <span class="muchsmaller">XCII.</span> i. p.</abbr> 526.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to observe, that the stones said
to originate from serpents petrified at the intercession of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keyne or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kenna, and supposed by Mr. Tonkin, according
to the philosophy of his day, to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lusus Naturæ</i>,
are the shells of extinct Nautili, called Cornua Ammonis,
from their resemblance to the horns sculptured on the
statues of Jupiter Ammon, found in abundance throughout
the neighbourhood of Kainsham, and in most of the formations
intermediate between the iron sand and red marle.</p>

<p>Transforming serpents into stone, seems to have been an
achievement as appropriate to Saints as was the encountering
<!--302.png--><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
of dragons to knights errant. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilda cleared her
favourite Island from these venomous reptiles; and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Patrick, more powerfully gifted, swept them from the whole
of Ireland at once.</p>

<p>It was at last observed, with no small degree of wonder,
that those metamorphosed snakes invariably wanted a head,
and the times of fabricating legends having passed by, this
phenomenon never received a solution from the cloister.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Brechan, the British Saint and King, the happy
father of twenty-six children, all sainted like himself, is
represented in the second plate of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot’s Church, in
what is called the Young Women’s Window, displaying
these twenty-six Saints, small in stature, within a fold of
his kingly robe.</p>

against sea or land, as sepes in Latin; from whence we
have our English words key or keys, wharfs for exportation
and importation of goods and merchandize over seas; no
improper appellation to the circumstances of this place,
where are several of that sort. It was taxed in the Domesday
Book, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, 1087, by the name of Landegey,
(and from thence the manor of Lan-digge in this parish,
contiguous therewith, and surrounding the same, is denominated;
now corrupted to Lansagey, alias Keye.) From
whence it is plainly evident that before the Norman Conquest
here was an endowed rectory church that received
tithes or tenths, of the profits of the earth, predial or
otherwise, towards the maintenance of the worship and
service of God, and doubtless invested with that benefit
by the Bishop of Bodmin or Cornwall, before that was

I take this place either to be part of or the voke lands of
the manor of Blanchland, i. e. white land, formerly the
lands of Albalanda, now Boscawen’s of Tregothnan, the
waste lands of which lordship is not only abounding in tin
and tin mines, but for about twenty years last past hath
yielded its owner about twenty thousand pounds out of its
coppermines, though the waste or down lands in which it is
found, is in many places scarce worth eighteen pence per
acre.</p>

<p>Guddarne in this parish, part of Blanchland manor, by
lease is the dwelling of Reginald Bauden, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married
Pendarves, his father Paynter, his grandfather Trewoolla.</p>

<p>In this place of Guddarne, in my youth, I was showed
by Mr. Bauden a brass or iron crock, containing about
eight gallons; wherein, as he said, his father found by
virtue of a dream of one Hendra, under Key Cross, in a
tempestuous night of wind, thunder, lightning, and rain, so
vast a quantity of gold and silver as not only advanced
him from the rank of rack-renter to that of a freeholder,
but from the distinction of a plebeian to that of a gentleman.</p>

<p>Kelleho, Kellyow, Killeyow, synonymous words in this

<p>From this family was descended Mr. John White, linendraper
in London, who having got much money by trading
in tin, settled lands of ten pounds per annum beyond
reprizes for ever, to be divided into four equal parts, between

the poor inhabitants of the four ancient coinage
towns in Cornwall, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Leskeard, Lestwithell, Truro, and
Helston; to be distributed by the ministers and churchwardens
of those churches on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s day yearly; the
remainder, being forty shillings, to be divided into four
equal parts between the four ministers of those churches,
who on that day in their respective churches annually are
to preach an anniversary sermon in remembrance of him
for ever, of which elsewhere (see Truro.)</p>

<p>In this parish of Kea on the open downs, by the highway
or street, are situate the four burrows, i. e. the four sepulchres,
tumuli, or graves, after the British-Roman manner,
to put those travellers that passed by in mind of mortality
and death; one of them is called Burrow Bel-les, i. e. the far
off, remote, broad or large burrow or sepulchre, (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> on
the confines of this parish) and suitable to its other names
it is one of the broadest or largest burrows in those parts;
into which some tinners, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> in hopes of
finding money, pierced a hole or adit into the centre
thereof, where, though they missed their expectations they
found in the same two of the broadest and flat moor-stones
as a cover, supported by three perpendicular stones of
suitable strength or bigness, that they had seen in the adjacent
country. In the vacant space, vault, or arch under
those stones, they found decayed or broken pieces of the
urn or ossilegium, and about a gallon of black matter
and ashes, which doubtless was the gleanings or remains of
that once famous human creature, before the fifth century
interred here, with many thousands others, doubtless of
less degree in the contiguous lands thereof, who had not
money to raise such troublesome, laborious, and costly funeral
monuments as those four burrows were, and still are.</p>

<p>Cur-Lyghon in this parish is now transnominated to

Bishop of Exeter. The incumbent Mr. Mitchell, the
oldest clergyman now living in this county; who though
aged, and his churches three miles apart from each other,
regularly serves them both every Sunday; he is since dead,
in 1731, and has been succeeded by the Reverend Walter
Borlase, <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr> and vicar of Maddern.</p>

<p>In this parish lies the extensive manor of Blanchland,
latinized into Albalonda. This manor gave name to a
considerable family, in which it continued for many descents.
The last of them, Otho de Albalonda, had only
one daughter and heir, Johanna, married in his lifetime to
John Boscawen, of Tregothnon, in the 31st year of Edward
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and carried this rich inheritance into that family;
in which it hath ever since continued, to their very great
advantage, having within these fifty years brought them
more money for copper than almost all the other mines in
the county together, if the last twenty years are excepted,
during which time great discoveries have been made in
various other places. Neither are the wastrels of this
manor destitute of good mines of tin; one of which, called
the White Works, occasioned a law-suit between Mr.
John Mayo, of Truro, owner of the tin bounds thereon,
and Mr. Hugh Boscawen, lord of the soil, towards the
latter end of the reign of Charles the Second.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayo claimed the farm or toll of the copper-ore,
<!--307.png--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
as well as of the tin, in right of his bounds; but the suit
was very justly determined in favour of Mr. Boscawen,
as Lord of the Soil, for that the right of the tin as bounder
was only by the custom of the Stannaries, and that no such
custom could be pleaded for copper ore.</p>

<p>This one suit put an end to all disputes between the
lords of the soil and the bounders, which otherwise
would have been endless, and very much to the discouragement
of copper mines; and there have not been
wanting some designing people of late, who made application
to King George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> then Prince of Wales, falsely representing
that much tin ore was carried into Wales with
the copper ore, and there separated from the copper, to his
great loss of duties.</p>

<p>Guddern. This place hath been for several generations
the seat, on lease from the family of Boscawen, of the Bowdens;
 perhaps ever since the Albalonda’s time, although
they were possessed of fair estates in fee elsewhere.</p>

<p>Reginald Bowden, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> is the present possessor.</p>

<p>Nansavallan. Avallan is an apple-tree, and the name
signifies the valley of apple-trees. This I take to have
been the chief seat of the Albalondas, as it hath been since
of some of the Boscawens; and particularly of late years
that of Charles Boscawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a younger son to Hugh
Boscawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and sometime Member of Parliament for
Tregony, and a Justice of the Peace. The arms of Albalonda
were, Gules, three bends Argent; Mr. Bowden’s,
Azure, a chevron between seven griffins’ heads couped
Or, each head transfixed by a dagger, the pommel Or, the
blade Proper.</p>

<p>Adjoining to Nansavallan is Kelliou, the groves, this
name being the plural of Kelli, a grove. It was once the
seat of a family of the same name, but whether they were
of the same stock with the Kellios of Lanleke and Rosiline
I am yet to learn. By a daughter and heir, this place,
if I am not mistaken, came to Edward Vivian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a
younger son to Vivian of Trenoweth, by whom he had only
<!--308.png--><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span>
one daughter and heir Jane, married to John Howeis, of
Redruth, whose great-grandson Reginald Howeis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> is
the present owner of it. He was Sheriff of Cornwall in
the tenth year of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1724, and hath married Susanna,
the eldest daughter and coheir of Edward Harris,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; and his brother Edward Howeis, Jane her younger
sister, and both have issue. The family of Howeis, give
for their arms, Azure, a fess wavy between three lions passant
Or, armed and langued Gules.</p>

<p>Trevoster. This place is very pleasantly situated on
Truro river, facing the town, from which it is but two
miles distant by water. This was a seat of a younger
branch of the Trevanion family, for here lived John
Trevanion, youngest son of John Trevanion, of Carhays,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> which John Trevanion had by his wife, the daughter
of &mdash;&mdash; Holland, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Devonshire, a son
of the same name, who married Marianne, the daughter of
John Somaster, of Painsford, in Devon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by whom he
had three daughters and coheiresses. Mary, married to
Richard Trefusis, of Trefusis, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; Joan, to William
Bligh, of Botathon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; and Alice to Nicholas Boscawen,
of Tregothnan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Since that, Trevoster has been held on lease by one of the
family of Davies, and now Mr. Howeis, of Killion, has a
lease of it on lives.</p>

<p>All these estates before mentioned, I take to be within
the manor of Blanchland, and I have passed by one place
in it to the north-west of the Great Works, called Kelly
freth: this was for several generations the seat, in lease from
the Boscawens, of the Winters, a younger branch of that
eminent family in Gloucestershire, and the family remained
here till very lately, giving for their arms, Sable, a fess
Ermine.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether it be worth while to take notice
of a place to the south of it, called Chase Water, which
being on the great road between Truro and Redruth, and
very near the Great Works, hath now several houses built
in it.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="title">The manor of Key, alias Landegay.</span>
<!--309.png--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span></p>

<p>I take this to be the same with that called by Mr. Carew
Landegy. I find this parish called Ecclesia de Landigay.</p>

<p>This manor was forfeited by Francis Tregion, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> with
the rest of his estate, as may be seen in Probus.</p>

<p>About the 8th or 9th Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> this manor was given or
sold for a small sum by the King to William Coryton, of
Newton, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in whose family it hath remained ever since.
On the commons belonging to Guddern is a large barrow
called Guddern Barrow, near which are several large
moorstones; and also at no great distance is another barrow,
called Craig Vrause, or the large barrow, remarkable
for giving name to some good mines of tin and copper
near it.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>All the legends of this parish concur in claiming for their
patron Saint Kea, one of the great company of missionaries,
and as the ludicrous, almost from a species of fatality, appears
to have blended itself with these ancient tales, a large
block of granite, hollow on one side, which happened to lie
near the bank of the river, was for centuries pointed out as
the boat used by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kea to waft himself from Ireland to
the Cornish shore; and so currently was this story repeated,
that, if persons went to sea in a vessel not adequate
to the service, it was observed they might as well have
made a voyage with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kea in his moorstone trough.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals having used a strange orthography for Nansavallan,
and given as fanciful a derivation of the word; both
are omitted, since Nans or Nance is known to be a vale; and
Avallan may be proved to be the Celtic name of an apple,
by referring to the History of Glastonbury. This seat of
the Albalandas presented within fifty years one of the most
venerable specimens in all that neighbourhood of the dwellings
used by gentlemen of consideration in former times.</p>

<p>It was entirely surrounded and sheltered by large trees,
<!--310.png--><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
and at some little distance stood a wood more extensive
than any one west of it; and both were conspicuous and
pleasing objects from the whole district round Truro; but
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auri sacri fames</i> has swept away the whole, and the place
is now become very little preferable to an open down. The
Editor expresses himself with some feeling on this subject,
having passed at Nanceavallan many happy weeks of his
childhood; and fancied the wood an exact counterpart of
that in which the favourite objects of infantine compassion
perished from want of food, and were painfully covered
over with leaves by the little bird, doubly consecrated by
this effort of his kindness.</p>

<p>In the hands of the proprietor, the farm of Nanceavallan
is however now improving, by extensive drainages, and by
a system of husbandry, that cannot fail of extending the
benefit derived from example to all the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Killiow is now the seat of Mr. Robert Lovell Gwatkin,
where he has built an almost entirely new house with extensive
gardens and plantations, improved the land, and
made the whole into a handsome modern residence.</p>

<p>To this gentleman the parish is also mainly indebted for
a removal of the church.</p>

<p>Either cultivation began on the banks of the river, or a
strong feeling of veneration was entertained for the spot
where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kea landed from his granite trough, but so
it happened that the church stood at one extremity of the
parish, and that by far the least populous. Mr. Gwatkin
led the way, and contributed largely towards constructing
a new church much nearer to the great mass of the inhabitants;
in this he was followed by other proprietors, and
a spacious church is now in use for divine service between
Killiow and Nanceavallan. Prayers, with a sermon suited
to the occasion, were first given, after reading the Bishop’s
license, on the <abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> of October 1802, being the feasten Sunday,
to a congregation so large as almost to fill the churchyard
as well as the church itself, which is decorated by
Mrs. Gwatkin, niece of Sir Joshua Reynolds, with paintings
which that great artist could not have failed to admire.
<!--311.png--><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
The tower alone remains to point out the site of the former
church.</p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Haweis, mentioned as the possessor of
Killiow by Hals, received his education as a Gentleman
Commoner of Exeter College; but he spent the whole
of the remainder of his life in retirement. One Oxford
anecdote he used to relate with peculiar pleasure. It
seems that he was selected to recite some Latin verses in
the theatre, commemorating the victory of Blenheim, an
event without parallel in the modern history of Europe
till the year 1815. In the verses occurred this apostrophe,
Quo, Tallarde! ruis? and as Mr. Haweis was actually
pronouncing these words, the Duke of Marlborough with
Marshal Tallard entered the theatre, amidst thunders of
applause. But possibly the entrance of Marshal Tallard
may be a mistake.</p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Haweis and his brother Edward, both
stated to have families, died childless; and the estate devolved
on Mr. David Haweis, the grandson of an uncle.</p>

<p>That uncle had been a beneficed clergyman, but was
deprived with the two thousand turned out to poverty and
to suffer persecution (see <a href="#Hilary"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary parish</a>) on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s
day 1662; a day ill chosen by those who might
recollect what happened on the same festival ninety years
before.</p>

<p>This gentleman having a family, and being without support,
found himself obliged to dispose of them in any way
to procure their own maintenance, and his eldest son submitted
to become a barber. His son was apprenticed to
the same trade; and on him the estate devolved. He married
a gentlewoman, Miss Kempe, of Roseland; but persevering
in low habits of intemperance, the peculiar vice
of that time, he died at an early age, leaving the property
to his widow for her life, with the remainder to his sisters.
They were married, and in stations not more elevated than
his own; their husbands were ready to pursue a line of
conduct similar to that which had cut short the ’squire’s
life; and in consequence, the whole reversionary interests
<!--312.png--><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pageno">308</span>
were soon dissipated, with the exception of one subdivided
portion, transmitted by a sister’s daughter, who died early
in life, to her only daughter, Mary Ann Jenkins, of whom
it may be sufficient to say, that if the whole estate had devolved
on her, it would have been in hands worthy of her
best ancestors.</p>

<p>On the banks of the river, directly opposite to Tregothnan,
the magnificent seat of Lord Falmouth, is a farm
called Trelease, belonging to the Editor; for beauty of
natural situation and for command of prospect, scarcely inferior
to Tregothnan itself.</p>

<p>But if ancient romances could be relied on as authorities,
the place most deserving of regard in this parish, or in
the whole county, after Tintagell Castle, would be Carlian,
since Thomas of Erceldowne, the celebrated northern
poet of the twelfth century, universally known by the
appellation of Thomas the Rhymer, describes Carlian as
the birth-place of the renowned Sir Tristrem, Knight of
the Round Table, companion of Arthur and the chief
hero of chivalry, where all exceed not merely the prowess,
but whatever the imagination can create in these degenerate
times. Yet perhaps the armies and fleets of England
may say,</p>

<p>Chase Water is now grown almost into a town.  A

of a dense population; but in such wretched taste as to
burlesque the worst imitation of Gothic.</p>

<p>In this town or borough of Killington, for retirement
and delight, lived Sir Edward Bray, Knight, originally
descended, as tradition says, from the Brays of Bray, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Just in Cornwall, that came into England with William
the Conqueror, otherwise from Ralph de Bray, Sheriff of
Hampshire, third of King John.</p>

<p><!--315.png--><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">311</span>
The Bray’s arms were, in a field Argent, a chevron
between three eagles’ legs erased at the knees Sable. He
gave also in a field Varry Purple and Argent, three bendlets
Gules.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald Bray, Knight Banneret and of the Garter,
Privy Councillor to King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> and Speaker of
the House of Commons in his eleventh year, is noted to
have made the usual protestation for himself to that King,
without any petition for the liberty of the Commons, as
is to be seen in modus tenendi Parliamentum: he was a
brother of the Lord Bray, or descended from the same
family. (See Camden in Hampshire.) Others will not
allow those Brays to be of British, but of French descent,
from the province of Bray in that country, and that
they came into England with the Conqueror, and that the
many places in Cornwall distinguished by the name of Bray
were denominated from them after their coming into England:
but of this query.</p>

<p>A Knight Banneret was made in the field or camp
of war, under the King’s standard, who was personally
present, by cutting off the point of his standard,
and making it a banner; after which they might display
their particular arms in a banner in the King’s army, and

<p>As for the name of this parish, which is a daughter
church to South Hill, and has for its patron saint <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas,
Bishop of Myra in Lycia, I take it to be Killy-Ton,
the town in a grove of trees.</p>

<p>Then follows a long conjectural account of the lords
of this manor, which is wholly uninteresting, and therefore
omitted.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.
<!--316.png--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span></p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin does not state on what authority he has
assigned the town and parish to the care of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas.
The popularity of this saint is now, and always has been,
so great as to render the fact of his being the patron very
probable. He is held in the highest veneration throughout
Russia.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas ran through the ordinary course of those
days. He became a monk, succeeded to the abbacy of his
convent; and when the clergy of Myra assembled to elect
a Bishop, and almost agreed in their choice, they were
divinely instructed to wait till the next day, and then to
choose the person who first offered himself to their notice,
on their opening the church-door. They obeyed; and in
the morning <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas was led to the spot by an irresistible
impulse. He assisted in overthrowing the Arians,
under the direction of Constantine, at the Council of Nice.
All these, however, were matters of frequent occurrence.
The fame of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas rests on something more unusual;
and if the tale is of a date sufficiently early, it may have
been the cause of his subsequent advancement, and of his
having obtained an influence so great as to effect the change
of his simple bishoprick into a metropolitan see, with
thirty-six suffragans.</p>

<p>So very early was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præcox ingenium</i> of this saint directed
towards observances, then deemed most acceptable
to the Divinity, that when an infant in arms he rigidly abstained,
every Wednesday and Friday, and on all other
days kept as fasts by the church, from touching his nurse’s
breast; for this truly wonderful ascetic achievement he has
been deservedly accounted the peculiar patron of children,
and more especially the preserver of their health.</p>

<p>He died in 342, and was buried in the Cathedral at
Myra; but in the year 1087 his relics were forcibly taken
from a country no longer Christian, and were enshrined
<!--317.png--><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
in the Cathedral of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen at <a name="err15" id="err15"></a>Bavi in Italy, where
pilgrims have ever since resorted in great numbers to witness
or to experience miraculous cures effected by his intercession
with Almighty God.</p>

<p>His festival is kept on the 6th of December, and on this
day the ludicrous or profane ceremony of the Boy Bishop
used to be exhibited in most Cathedrals. At Salisbury a
boy is represented on a monument, dressed in the habit of
a bishop including the mitre; and this is said to have been
occasioned by the lad dying in his mock pontificate.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons states, that the manor of Callington has
passed through various families, Ferrers, Champernowne,
Willoughby, Dennis, and Rolle.</p>

<p>The heiress of Samuel Rolle brought it to Robert
Walpole, Earl of Orford, son of Sir Robert Walpole;
and on the death of his son George Walpole in 1791,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine prole</i>, this property passed to Mr. Robert George
William Trefusis, of Trefusis in Cornwall, together with
the barony of Clinton, created by writ of summons to Parliament
in the reign of Edward the First.</p>

<p>George Walpole, Earl of Orford, executed a deed
by which, after reserving a life interest to himself, and a
power of revocation never acted on, he settled the remainder
in fee of all such property as came to him from
his maternal relations, on the right heir of Samuel Rolle,
son of Robert Rolle and Arabella Clinton, his ancestor,
from whom the Barony had descended; but his legal adviser
forgot a most important distinction between deeds
and wills; a will not coming into action till after the testator’s
death, when Mr. Trefusis would have been the
undoubted heir of Samuel Rolle; but the deed, being
effective from the instant of its execution, vested the
remainder in Mr. George Walpole himself, the then
heir of Samuel Rolle; and on his decease carried the
property which had vested in him by act of law, although
in direct opposition to his wishes and intention, from the
<!--318.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
maternal line to that of his father. Fortunately, however,
in this instance, the whole was under mortgage, which
brought the cognizance of the affair into Chancery. Mr.
Trefusis took possession unopposed; and proceedings
to obtain the property in consequence of the mistake,
were not commenced till after twenty years, when a solemn
decision of the House of Lords declared that the interference
came too late for disturbing matters in equity.</p>

<p>It is obvious that Mr. George Walpole should have settled
the remainder in fee on such person as would be the
heir of Samuel Rolle after his own decease, or perhaps in
trustees for such person. Mr. Trefusis (Lord Clinton)

<p>The north-eastern part of this parish extends to the foot
of Kitt Hill, the most elevated point in Hingston Down,
which is composed of granite. The slate adjoining thereto
resembles that which occurs in similar situations in the
parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey; and it has also
been the scene of mining speculations. As the town of
Callington is approached, the slate becomes of a darker
<!--319.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
blue, and passes into hornblende rock, which prevails in
the other parts of this parish; but where quartz predominates,
the land is barren. This rock, however, does not
possess here a very marked character, nor is it frequently
exposed to view; near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eve it appears to graduate into
the calcareous series.</p>

of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the
value of Cornish benefices, 1294, there is no such church as
Kenwen named then in the hundred of Powdre; if it were
then extant, at that time it had no endowment; however, I
find in the 15th granted by the Clergy, the 24th Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>
1447, the parish of Kenwen in Powdre was rated 2<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 19<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>;

<p>Near Edles, or Ideless, i. e. narrow breadth (formerly
the voke lands of a considerable manor, taxed in Domesday
Book as aforesaid, privileged then with the jurisdiction
of a Court Leet) is yet to be seen the ruins and downfalls
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare’s consecrated and walled well; chapelwise
built, by the Nuns of the nunnery-house of Poor Clares in
Trurow, called An-hell, i. e. the hall; but yet, alas! as tradition
<!--320.png--><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
saith, they were not so poor as their rule obligeth
them to be, for in the walls of this well they had deposited
or hid away considerable sums of money, which, by tradition
or some dream, was discovered tempore James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> to
some of the inhabitants of this parish, who one night pulled
down the walls and totally defaced this chapel-well in quest
thereof, and probably succeeded in their design and undertaking,
for soon after some poor labourers in agriculture
became rich farmers and landed men, and others. From
this place was denominated a family of gentlemen, surnamed
de Idless, whose heir was married to Hamley, tempore
Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p>Trega-veth-an, in this parish, the grave town or dwelling,
so called from the cemetery and free chapel yet extant
here, of public use before the church of Kenwen was
erected; which barton and manor for several descents was
the lands of a Welch family of gentlemen surnamed de
Langhairons; i. e. holy or sacred laws; till the latter end
of the reign of King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> when Mr. Langhairne
sold this barton to Walter Vincent, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, barrister at law,
and the manor to Mr. Bawden and others. The arms of
Langhairne were Azure, a chevron between three escallops
Or.</p>

<p>Chyn-coos in this parish, i. e. the wood-house, formerly
surrounded with woods, is the dwelling of Thomas Hawes,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>, that married Hawes of Kea, and Paynter; and
giveth the same arms as the Hawses of Kea.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>The manor of Tregavethan.</p>

<p>This signifies the dwelling in the meadows, vethen being
the same with bither, a meadow; and whoever sees the
place will be soon convinced of the truth of this etymology.</p>

<p>Tregedick was lord of the manor and sometimes dwelt
here, but having only one daughter and heir, the barton
passed with her to &mdash;&mdash; Langhairne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, but the father having
<!--321.png--><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
reserved the manor, he in consequence of some difference
sold it. The Langhairnes, however, continued to reside on
the barton in much esteem till the great Civil Wars, in
which this family suffered so much as to be compelled to
sell it; and it came at last into the possession of Henry
Vincent, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>, of Tresinsple, who let out the barton in
leases to several tenants, so that it is now become a village,
and little of the mansion or house left standing.</p>

<p>To the west of Tregavethan, or the high town, on the
confines between this parish and those of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes and
Perran in the Sands, are three great barrows, called the
Three Barrows; and about a mile to the westward of these
on very high ground are four barrows, one belonging to
this manor and the other three to Lambourn in Perran.
These barrows give name to the downs, and the great road
from London to the Land’s End passes between them. They
were doubtless the burying places of some principal commanders,
and probably Danes. To the left of Tregavethan
and within the manor, is Roseworth, the Green Valley.
This was once a seat of the family of Cosens; and here
lived Nicholas Cosens, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who was Sheriff of Cornwall in
the year 1660. He dying without issue left it to his
widow, and after his death it became the property of
Samuel Enys, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by purchase.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Kenwyn may be said to include the old part of Truro,
which occupies the mere extremity of a point or tongue of
land stretching from this parish and enclosed between two
rivers. The land immediately round the town is fertile, in
a high state of cultivation, and decorated by trees and villas;
but towards the Four Barrow Down and Chasewater,
nothing can be more desolate than the barren commons
studded with heaps of rubbish from deserted mines.</p>

<p>In this parish are situate two of the earliest establishments
for smelting tin by means of coal, and on the largest
scale of any in the county, Calenick and Cavedras; but
<!--322.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
of late years this business has taken an entirely new character;
tin ores are sold, like those of copper, by public
tender or ticketings, and smelting houses are constructed
in some cases for the use of particular mines.</p>

<p>The manor of Newham formed part of the Bodregan
property, and after the despoiling of Sir Henry Bodregan
by King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> it was given to Trevanion, of whom
it was purchased by the late Mr. Ralph Allen Daniell,
sometime member for West Looe, by whom a handsome
house has been built on the side of the river, half a mile
below Truro; Bosvigo is also a gentleman’s seat.</p>

<p>And at Comprigney, near Bosvigo, the Editor apprehends
that several ancestors in succession of General Sir
Hussey Vivian resided. Kenwyn church and tower, with
an excellent glebe house adjacent, built about the year
1780, are very conspicuous objects, and command themselves
a fine view of the town and river. The church is provided
with a set of bells said to surpass all others in the country;
and to have been placed there when ringing was a favourite
amusement with the neighbouring gentlemen.</p>

<p>This parish measures 8,094 statute acres.</p>

<p>Part of this new parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne, at the time of the
Norman Conquest, was rated in the Domesday Book, 1087,
under the jurisdiction of Treleage (i. e. Physician or Surgeon’s
Town, or the Law Town); it is now the possession
of Robert Buggin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> (id est, Bacon) who married Prudence,

<abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 1550, whose ancestors were merchants of that
town, and gave for their arms, Sable, a cocatrice displayed
Argent, membered and taloned Gules.</p>

<p>Note further, that as ker, kerr, kyr, kir, signifies dear,
beloved, choicely affectioned, in British, Cornish, and the
Armorick languages, answerable to dilectus in Latin; so
from thence proceeds Kerryer, a lover, or one dearly
affectioned. See Floyd upon <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dilectus</i>.</p>

<p>Tre-land in this parish (either the temple town, or a
town notable for land) was another district or manor, taxed
in Domesday Roll; and I take it, there are yet extant two
tenements here called Tre-land Vear, and Tre-land Vean;
i. e. the greater and less Tre-lands. One of those places,
as I am informed, is the dwelling of John Hayme, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
(Saxon, i. e. a house, home, or covering; see also Verstegan
upon this word) that married Tregose; his father Boggans.</p>

<p>In this parish is situate Condura and Tregarne, manors
formerly pertaining to Condura, Earl of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Lanareh, also Lan-arth, in this parish is the dwelling of
Sampson Sanns, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>, that married Cood, which tenement
or barton was formerly the lands of Kensham, who
sold it to the present possessors.</p>

<p>This Mr. Sanns died without legal issue about the year
1696, and left his estate to his brother’s son, John Sanns,
that married Hamley of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, now in possession thereof,
who in the month of January, in the afternoon, in the year
1702, with seven other persons, men and women of this
parish, coming by sea from Falmouth town and harbour
towards their own homes in a fishing boat of about five
tons burden, without deck or covering, on a fair day; and
having got off at sea about a league beyond the said harbour,
and within two leagues of their dwelling to the west; suddenly
<!--325.png--><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pageno">321</span>
there happened to arise a high and mighty storm of
wind against them, which rose the rapid waves of the sea
to that degree, that the boatmen or oarmen, with all their
skill or strength, were not able to put the boat further
forward without its being filled with water or swallowed up
with the raging sea.</p>

<p>Whereupon, despairing of getting home to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne,
they all resolved if possible to return back to Falmouth
harbour before this tempestuous storm of wind that blew
that way, or to run on shore on any other part of the
country as they could. But, alas! they no sooner attempted
those expedients, and turned their boat, but
instantly the wind turned and thwarted their design. In
this extremity they knew not what to do; both wind and
water being thus outrageous against them: and that which
added more to their calamity was, that, through their long
toiling at sea, the light of the sun was past and night
approached.</p>

<p>Then every person present being at their wit’s end,
called upon his God for pardon of their sins, and mercy
upon their souls, as despairing of the preservation of their
bodies from the merciless element of the seas; when at
length, after much fervent prayers, tears, and cries, the
watermen proposed, all other their endeavours failing, that
the boat must be left to drive before the wind and sea, to
such port or place as God in his infinite mercy and providence
should guide it.</p>

<p>This course was taken, and the boat forthwith, by letting
loose its helm, in a dark long night and most tremendous
storm or hurricane, followed the current of the wind and
waves all night; the passengers every minute casting out of
the boat such water as the outrageous seas cast in upon
her, least she might thereby be overwhelmed or filled
therewith. At length the glimpse of daylight appeared, when
they beheld themselves environed with the billows of the
great ocean, without sight of either sun, moon, stars, or land.
The storm still continuing all that day and the night after,
<!--326.png--><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
also the third day and the night after, the boat and mariners
in the same condition as aforesaid, when afterwards the
fourth day in the morning, the wind and seas being somewhat
abated of their fury and violence, about ten of the
clock they discovered land, and forthwith rowed and
steered the boat to the sea-shore thereof, where they
arrived with the boat safely; which happened to be, as I
was informed, on the coast of Normandy in France, about
a hundred leagues distance from the place the boat first
was driven off at sea. Which happened to be at such
time as Queen Anne had wars with the French King. As
soon as Mr. Sanns and his companions stept on land, they
were met by three or four men with fusees, demanding
what they were (as they judged, for they understood not
French), to which they replied they were English; which
one of them that understood the English tongue hearing,
demanded the occasion of their coming there, and by what
expedient they came over; the particulars of which hearing,
as aforesaid, they were all astonished to hear of their
hazardous passage, miraculous preservation, and to behold
the boat, the instrument thereof next Providence.</p>

<p>Upon which discourse, a gentleman of the company asked
Mr. Sanns what part of England he was born in, to
which he replied Cornwall; and further interrogated him
whether his name were not Sanns, to which he replied that
it was; ‘Why then,’ said the gentleman, ‘I know your person,
and well remember the kindness you shewed me in my
distress many years since at your house, when the ship in which
I was, was cast away and lost on the coast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevern;’
understanding which, after they embraced each other. Then,
he demanded their arms and money, if any; whereupon
Mr. Sanns having with him forty guineas that he had
received at Falmouth for pilchards, the day before his boat
was driven off at sea, he forthwith delivered it to his friend,
who told him he and his companions must yield themselves
prisoners of war; which accordingly they did, and Mr.
Sanns was taken home to the gentleman’s house. After
<!--327.png--><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pageno">323</span>
which they were all examined concerning the premises
before a justice of the peace, who finding matters as aforesaid,
ordered that they should not be kept in custody as
prisoners of war, but be all permitted to go at liberty and
beg the alms of the people; whereupon they found extraordinary
charity and favour amongst them, since they were
not enemies, but persons by fate or Providence, brought
there after an especial manner, and preserved from the
violence of the seas by the great Maker and Protector of all
things.</p>

<p>The news whereof forthwith not only flew over the
country, but was transmitted to the cognizance of King
Lewis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>, who thereupon ordered that by the first
transport ship for prisoners of war, they should all be
sent home freely into England; which happening soon
after, Mr. Sanns took his leave of his kind landlord, in
whose house he had been dieted and entertained, and was
content to leave the forty guineas aforesaid with him, as his
recompence; but contrary to his expectation the gentleman
gave the same to him again, saying he would take nothing
of that kind at his hands, since God in such a wonderful
manner had preserved him and his companions from the
great danger of the seas. Whereupon, he presented five
or six guineas to his wife, who after some reluctancy accepted
thereof, and so they parted and went on board a
transport ship, and safely landed at Portsmouth; and in
about eight weeks after their departure from England,
returned safe to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne, to the great joy and astonishment
of their friends and relations, who concluded them all
drowned long before.</p>

<p>And that the reader may not think those people’s subsistence
three nights and four days in their dangerous sea
voyage, was as supernatural as their preservation, it must
be remembered, that one of Mr. Sanns’ companions being
a woman that was an inn-keeper, had bought at Falmouth
town before they departed thence, for to sell to her
customers, twelve pennyworth of white bread and three
<!--328.png--><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
or four gallons of brandy, which proved the material support
of their lives. Matthew of Westminster, our Chronologer,
tells us that about the year 900, Dusblan, Machreu
and one Maxlium, in a boat made of one ox skin and a half,
with seven days provisions, in two days and a night arrived
miraculously into Cornwall from Ireland, at the Mount’s
Bay.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin does not add any thing to Mr. Hals’s narrative,
except the single observation,</p>

<p>It takes its name from the famous <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keven.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne’s fame does not extend out of Cornwall. He
must have been one of the Irish missionaries who crossed
the seas in granite troughs, or in skiffs made of bullocks’
hides. Tales were in circulation about mutual visits from
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Perran and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevern, but they contain only vulgar
incidents of modern fabrication.</p>

<p>The extraordinary escape of the passengers from Falmouth,
is retained at the full length in which Mr. Hals
relates it, as the narrative bears evident marks of authenticity,
and the incidents are creditable to all the parties
introduced.</p>

<p>This parish is amply provided with small harbours or
coves affording shelter to boats, and the shore admits of
using seine nets for taking pilchards. The principal of
these harbours, Coverack, has been long noted for an
extensive trade, still more lucrative than fishing; the other
two are Porthoustock (Proustock) and Porthalla (Prala).</p>

<p>About seventy years since a large shoal of pilchards came
into the cove at Porthoustock, while the seine boats were
on the outside. One of these extended its net across the
entrance and shut in the whole; but salt in sufficient quantity
<!--329.png--><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pageno">325</span>
could not be procured for saving them, when the
fishermen resolved on the hazardous expedient of sailing
to France for a supply; the weather continued fine till
their return, and they are reported to have prepared for
exportation above a thousand hogsheads. The Church is
situated on the highest ground in this whole district, having
the addition of a spire instead of the lofty tower usual in
Cornwall. The existing spire is of recent date, although
probably on the model of that which was destroyed by
lightning on the 28th of February 1770.</p>

<p>For a very accurate and able account of this thunder
storm, which occurred during divine service, and seems to
have been one of the most violent on record, see a
paper in the 61st <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> of the Philosophical Transactions,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 71, <abbr title="article">art.</abbr> 8, 1771; (and <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 13, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 98, of the Abridgment,)
by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Anthony Williams, then Vicar.</p>

<p>The spire was rent in pieces. The roof of the church
almost entirely destroyed; large stones scattered over the
floor, and small stones on the outside carried to a distance
little short of a quarter of a mile. Mr. Williams himself
was rendered insensible, the whole congregation, with very
few exceptions, fell on the ground deprived of all recollection;
but no life was lost, nor did any sustain a serious
injury; about ten were slightly hurt.</p>

<p>In the church are several monuments; and in the churchyard
stands a large sarcophagus, having sculptured on it
the representation of a shipwreck, and military emblems,
with the following inscription.</p>

The ship was known to be very old and in bad repair;
but, although the wind blew with some violence, it would
have been a matter of no difficulty whatever to clear the
Mein Egles, or Manacles Rocks. Seamen have therefore
conjectured that the Captain kept near the shore for the
purpose of stranding his vessel, to obtain the exaggerated
value contracted for with the Government; and that in
attempting this fraud, he fell on the rocks which caused the
loss of every one on board.</p>

<p>Mr. Cavendish was a son of Lord George Cavendish, of
East Bourn, Sussex, afterwards created Earl of Burlington.</p>

<p>The great tithes of this parish have been sold to the various
proprietors of the land.</p>

<p>The tithes of fish belonged, however, to Mr. Matthew
Wills of Helston, in right of his marriage with the only
daughter of Mr. Tonkin of Trenance near Porthoustock.
For some years they were of considerable value, but as all
tithe of fish is allowed to be in this country the mere
creature of custom, the custom then acted on was attacked
at law, and after a trial, on which the celebrated Mr. Dunning
attended by a special retainer, it was overturned.
Trenance and the other property in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevern are now possessed
by his son, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Wills, Vicar of Wendron,
for about fifty years.</p>

<p>Kilter, in this parish, was the birthplace and probably
belonged to the individual of that name, who with Humphry
Arundell and others, excited the common people to take
arms against the government of King Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> in 1549,
by holding out those unattainable objects which have
misled the ignorant to their own destruction in all ages
and nations, in union with others certainly of a different
description; one of which was the re-establishment of the
Bloody Statute, or the Six Articles, by which every person
refusing to acknowledge the King’s supremacy over the
church was adjudged to be hanged; and every one conscientiously
disbelieving the real presence of Christ’s body
in consecrated bread and wine, was condemned to be
burnt alive.</p>

Lanarth has been for a considerable time the residence
of the Sandys family. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Sampson Sandys lived
there to a very advanced age. He was probably grandson
to the gentleman whose wonderful escape to the coast of
France is detailed by Mr. Hals under the name of Sanns,
which the editor remembers to have heard was the original
appellation of their family, till they adopted the name and
cross-crosslets of the Sandys of Ombersley.</p>

<p>Mr. Sampson Sandys was succeeded at Lanarth by his
nephew, Mr. William Sandys, a colonel in the army of the
East India Company, who rebuilt the house, and greatly
improved the place.</p>

<p>The rectory was, before the Reformation, appropriated
to the Abbey of Beaulieu in Hampshire, founded by King
John.</p>

<p>The reasons assigned for King John founding this magnificent
Cistercian Abbey of Beaulieu, or De Bello Loco, are
so curious, and so illustrative of the profligacy and weak
superstition united in forming his character, that the
Editor thinks it right to insert the following original, with
a translation.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the sixth year of his reign King John founded a certain
monastery of the Cistercian order in England, and
gave it the name of Beaulieu; and the following account is
given of the cause which induced the King to found this
abbey.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The King, without any just cause of offence, having taken
the most violent and unbounded anger against the Abbats
and others of the Cistercians, and having immoderately oppressed
<!--333.png--><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">329</span>
them through the medium of his officers, the
Abbats of the said order came to a Parliament which the
King held at Lincoln, to try if they might be able by some
means to obtain a small share of the King’s grace and
favour. But when the King saw them, he became so cruelly
disposed towards them, as to order that the said Abbats
should, in the most disgustful manner, be trodden under
the horses’ feet; but his people being unwilling to execute
a command so unjust, so atrocious, and hitherto unheard-of
from any Christian prince, those Lord Abbats, now
despairing of any kindness on the part of the King, hastily
retired to their hostels. But in the following night, as the
said King John lay sleeping on his bed, it seemed to him
that he was brought before some judge, these Abbats standing
by, whom the judge ordered to scourge him on the
back with whips and rods; and when the King awoke in
the morning, he declared that he actually felt the scourging.
Having related his dream to a certain ecclesiastic of his
court, this person assured him that God had been merciful
to him beyond measure, by deigning thus kindly and paternally
to correct him in this present life, and by revealing to
him his mysteries; and he advised the King to send immediately
for the Abbats of this order, and humbly to implore
from them the pardon of his offence.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The King consenting, a message was sent to them that
they should come to the King; which they hearing from
the messenger, thought that they should be banished from
England: but God, who never deserts his servants, disposed
things otherwise; so that when they came into the
King’s presence, he put away the anger which he had entertained
against them.”</p>

<p>There is not any trace of the advowson of the vicarage
having belonged to this splendid abbey, which afforded
sanctuary to Queen Margaret and Perkin Warbeck. It is
now possessed either by Mr. Pascoe, the present incumbent,
or by his family.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>There are few spots that have excited greater geological
interest than the serpentine tract of the Lizard, and no part
of it will be found more instructive than this parish.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevern rests on magnesian
rocks; but north of a line drawn from Porthalla, nearly
due west to Goonhilly Downs, the rocks belong to the calcareous
series. The latter rocks may be seen on the coast
from Porthalla to the Nare Point, and will be found to
resemble the series between Gorran and the Dodman
Point. On the left side of Porthalla Cove the blue slate
abounds in veins and in irregular nodules of calcspar; and
at low-water-mark a more compact variety is exposed,
which evidently forms the passage into the black limestone,
loose fragments of which are sometimes found on the shore.
In a small creek within the Nare near Bostowda, is a large
patch of conglomerate, the pebbles and fragments of which
have been derived from the rocks which line the banks of
the river Hellas as high up as Gweek; but which bear no
resemblance to the rock of the immediate vicinity. This is
the most decided instance of a fragmentary rock in Cornwall.</p>

<p>The hollow occupied by the little stream which discharges
itself at Porthalla divides the calcareous shale from
a rock of totally different nature, videlicet serpentine,
<!--335.png--><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">331</span>
several varieties of which form the neck of land stretching
thence to Dranna Point.</p>

<p>At Porthoustock a glossy lamellar rock, already noticed
as joining the serpentine at Cadgwith, forms each side of
the cove; but here, on proceeding to the Manacles Point it
may be seen passing into diallage rock: the latter extends
so far as Coverack, and also inland to the foot of Goonhilly
Downs. At Coverack the diallage rock appears to pass
into serpentine; but here again, as at Porthalla, the junction
is a concrete. The varieties of serpentine near
Coverack Pier are numerous, and several of them may be
seen passing into each other, which in other parts of the
Lizard district form large and apparently independent
masses. From Coverack to Kennick Cove the cliffs are
very bold, and display different kinds of serpentine and
diallage rocks, and at Blockhead a large stratum of indurated
steatite, beautifully marked with brown arborescent
figures on a yellow ground. At Kennick Cove, red and
olive green serpentine, abounding in scales of diallage, and
traversed by numerous veins of asbestos, talc, and calcareous
spar, are exposed to view on a grand scale; and at
Gwinter, a little north of the cove, diallage rock is accompanied
by layers of beautiful violet-coloured jade, or compact
felspar, containing large plates of diallage as metalloide
as at Coverack.</p>

<p>It may be noticed here, that all the uncultivated land
extending over serpentine formation, is clothed with the
most beautiful of European heaths; the Erica Vagans of
Linnæus, so named on account of its being found in various
parts of the world on particular spots. Hudson named it
“Multiflora” from its splendid inflorescense; and Dr. Withering,
with some others, didyma, with reference to double
antheræ on each flower. This heath bounds itself almost
within a yard to the limits of the magnesian earths.</p>

<p>The manor and barton of Lanew in this parish, was formerly
the lands of the Beavills of Gwarnack or Killygarth;
by one of whose heirs, as I am informed, it came in
marriage to the Grenvills of Stowe; and was entailed,
together with the barton of Bryn, and other lands, upon
the issue of the said Beavill, by Grenvill to be begotten.</p>

<p>Now it happened, tempore Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, that Sir Bevill
Grenvill, being much encumbered with the debts of his ancestors,
in order to free the same, sold for a valuable consideration
this manor of Lanow and barton of Bryn to William
<!--337.png--><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pageno">333</span>
Noye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Attorney-general to King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> the which
William Noye and his heirs quietly enjoyed the same for about
thirty years’ space, till King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> returned from his
exile beyond the seas, and was restored to his dominions
1660; at which time Sir John Grenvill, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> afterwards
created Earl of Bath, (son of the said Sir Bevill Grenvill)
then also in exile with the said King beyond the seas, came
back to his native country with the said King; and some
time after delivered leases of ejectment, on writs of ejection,
firme formedon, or right, to the tenants of Humphrey
Noye, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> then in possession thereof, son of the
said Attorney-general Noye, and brought down a venire
facias and trial for the same, at Lanceston assizes, where,
on the issue, the verdict passed for the said Earl of Bath;
and after judgment was entered up and recorded thereupon,
writs for possession were sued forth, and his lordship became
seised of those lands, and forced the tenants thereof
to double their accustomed rent, on condition of holding
their leases. Afterwards Noye’s son aforesaid, files his bill
in chancery, suggesting the wrong he had received by this
verdict at law, whereby he lost his lands and purchase
money, which matter coming to a hearing on bill and answer,
an issue was directed out of Chancery to try once
more this title at common law, on which Noye proved Sir
Beavill Grenvill to be tenant in tail for those lands, and
that he levying a fine thereon, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">come ceo qui il eit de son
done</i>, according to due form of law, with deeds declaring
the same to be for the use of the said William Noye, his
heirs and assigns for ever, that was a sufficient dock of the
entail, and bar to the son and heir of the said Sir Beavill
Grenvill, whereupon the sense and judgment of the Court
then was, that according to law the verdict must be for
Noye: as accordingly it then passed. Notwithstanding
which, a cross bill was filed by the Earl of Bath against
Noye, about the premises, praying a writ of injunction for
stopping further proceedings at common law; whereupon
his lordship still kept possession, and Noye grew weary of
<!--338.png--><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pageno">334</span>
this controversy, who, otherwise, was a man much depressed
with debt, and therefore an unequal contester with the
then great Earl of Bath; wherefore he sold his title to those
lands in dispute to Mr. Christopher Davies, of Burnewall
in Buryan, who revived Noye’s drooping case and title to
the premises, and delivered ejectments to the Earl of
Bath’s tenants, then in possession thereof, and accordingly
brought down a trial at Lanceston upon that plea and demise,
tempore James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, when it was manifest his lordship
relied more on his privilege as a Peer or Baron of this
Realm than the right or justice of the merits of his case,
for he served all the council, officers, and attornies of the
court at that assizes with writs of privilege; so that no person
was permitted to speak or act publicly on the part or
title of Noye or Davies; but the case or trial was immerged
or was swallowed up without due course or form of law, so
that Mr. Davies was only permitted to plead his case himself,
which he did with so much judgment, sense, law, and
equity, as the Court admired at it, being no lawyer. But,
alas! he wanted instruction in the grand point in such cases,
to have cried out a merger or emerger, and the verdict
must have been for him or Noye the second time.</p>

<p>After which bad success, and for that Mr. Davies was
threatened to be sued on the statute of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scandalum magnatum</i>,
for words said to be spoken by him reflective on his
lordship’s honour and reputation, he was terrified into a
composition or agreement with the said Earl, by the end of
Hilary term then next ensuing, for the consideration of
500<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> to levy a fine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur cognizance de droit</i>, with proclamation
on those lands, with deeds declaring the uses thereof
to be only to the proper use and behoof of the said Earl of
Bath, his heirs and assigns for ever, as accordingly was
performed, and so this controversy ended. But, alas!
when too late it appeared further, that when Mr. Davies
had sold his title to this manor of Lanow as aforesaid, that
there were two tenements of Mr. Noye’s paternal estate
whilst he was in possession thereof, after his purchase from
<!--339.png--><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pageno">335</span>
Grenvill, that he had annexed to the said manor, situate in
this parish, and worth 900<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, which Mr. Davies ignorantly
debarred himself of, to his greater loss. See Withell parish
for Bryn, the lands of Bevill and Grenvill.</p>

<p>Bo-Kelly in this parish was the dwelling of the genteel
family surnamed Carn-sew, i. e. dry, sterile, or barren spar-stone,
or rock; perhaps so called from the local place of
Carnsew in Mabe, altogether under such circumstances;
otherwise Mr. Carew tells us the name of those gentlemen
was Carn-deaw, i. e. black spar-stone or rock. William
Carnsew of this house was sheriff of Cornwall 18 Edward
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>; William Carnsew was Sheriff of Cornwall 3
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></p>

<p>Richard Carnsew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards knighted, was Sheriff
of Cornwall 17 Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1642, whose heir George Carnsew,
as I am told, sold it to Tregagle, and is now by lease
in possession of John Nicholls, of Trewane, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> The
two only daughters and heirs of Sir Richard Carnsew, of
Tregarne, were married to Prideaux, of Fewborough, and
Godolphin of the younger house, whose arms were, Sable,
a goat passant Argent, attired Or.</p>

<p>Tre-havar-ike, alias Tre-ar-ike, gave name and original
to an old family of gentlemen, from thence surnamed
de Trehauarike, whose sole inheritrix was married to
Cavall, tempore Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> who, out of a supposed allusion
to this name, as appears from the glass windows of
this house, gave a calf for their arms, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Argent, a calf
passant Gules; whereas Leugh is a calf in British-Cornish,
and Cavall is a bee-hive, cradle, or flasket. They gave
also, Azure, three sails of a ship Argent; for that, as tradition
saith, one of this family was admiral of a squadron of
ships at sea, under King Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> against the French;
finally, about the year 1612, the two sole daughters and
heirs of those Cavalls were married to Vivian, of Trenowth
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, and Hore of Trenowth in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewan. Upon
the division of Cavall’s lands, this barton and manor fell
to Vivian’s share, whose grandson Thomas Vivian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
<!--340.png--><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pageno">336</span>
sold this barton to John Peter, of Treater, gentleman, for
2,100<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; and the manor to other persons, now in possession
thereof, about the year 1700.</p>

<p>At the top of those lands is a field called the Dower
Park, i. e. the water field, where a spring or pool of water
commonly stands, which gives the spring, or original of the
aforesaid riveret of water, from whence Trehavarike is denominated.</p>

<p>At Tregeare in this parish, and Resurra in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Minver,
was the seat of the Penkivells, gentlemen of ancient descent,
and heretofore of great revenues, now comparatively
extinct.</p>

<p>Pen-pons in this parish, now Pen-pont, synonymous
words, signifies the head bridge, or the bridge at the head
or top of the sea in this place, according to the natural and
artificial circumstances thereof, which was the voke lands
of an ancient and extensive manor, privileged with the
jurisdiction of a court leet before the Norman Conquest;
for by the name of Penpont it was rated in the Domesday
Tax 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087; from whence was denominated an
ancient family of gentlemen now extinct, surnamed Penpons,
whose sole inheritrix was married to Arundell of Tolverne,
tempore Queen Mary, from whose heirs and assigns
it came to Cole and Arscott of Devon, and others, now in
possession thereof. By the inquisition 12 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> it
was rated for twenty-one Cornish acres, before the judges
Solomon de Ross and others, at Lanceston, that is to say,
1260 statute acres. I take the tenure of this manor to be
either customary or copyhold lands; near which is still extant
Chappell Amble, or Ambhull, i. e. the dull, blockish,
or ignorant chapel or chaplain, a free chapel, where the
Bishop never visited.</p>

<p>In this parish at Middle Amble is the dwelling of Jonathan
Webber, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> (id est, in Saxon, a weaver, so called
from his first ancestor, who was of that trade or occupation,)
who married Williams, and giveth for his arms,
Gules, on a chevron engrailed Or, charged with three annulets
<!--341.png--><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pageno">337</span>
or round plates Azure, pierced in the middle, Or,
between three round plates or platters, two in chief and
one in the base, Argent. This family, as it branched downwards
to the year 1640, had married with Mathew of the
said parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew, who gave for his arms, Sable, a
crane Argent, legged and beaked Gules; also with Prewbody
and Polwhele. This arms of Webber, consisting of
four colours in its field and in its charge, is a ridiculous or
contemptible bearing, as heralds tell us all such bearings are.</p>

<p>Note further that Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall,
<abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1602, tells us, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 55, that John, the son of
Thomas, living at Pendarves, took up the name of John
Thomas Pendarves, and that Richard his younger brother
took up the name of Richard Thomas Pendarves; and
that Trengone, living at Nance, took up the name of
Nance; and Bonython, living at Carclew in Milor, took
up the name of Carclew; and for the same reason two brothers
of the Thomases, living at Carnsew in Mabe, another
at Roscrow in Milor or Gluvias, took up the names of
Carnsew and Roscrow; as did also one of them living
at Caweth in Mabe, take up the name of Caweth; and
in further testimony thereof, give one and the same
coat armour as Thomas did, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field Argent, a
chevron between three talbots Sable, though Pendarves
gives a different arms from that of Thomas. See Cambourne.
Query, whether Carnsew of Bokelly does not derive
his name from Carnsew? i. e. dry rock, in Mabe parish.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>This parish takes its present name from the patron saint
Kew, which, says the author of the English Dictionary,
<abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr> London, 1691, is certainly the same with Kebius the
Briton. The impropriator of the sheaf and patron of the
vicarage, is at present Robert Croker, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by purchase
<!--342.png--><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pageno">338</span>
from Mr. John Tregeagle. The incumbent, Mr. Edward
Stephens, Mr. Croker’s nephew.</p>

<p>The ancient name of this parish was Lanow.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>If Saint Kebius is really the patron of this parish, and
has given it his name somewhat disguised in the sound of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew, he has the unusual felicity of being honoured in
his own country. Doctor Borlase states, on the authority of
Archbishop Usher, (Antiquities of Cornwall, <abbr title="second edition">2d. ed.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 369.)
“About the middle of the fourth century, Solomon Duke
of Cornwall seems to have been a Christian; for his son
Kebius was ordained a Bishop by Hilarius, Bishop of Poictiers,
in France; and afterwards returned into his own
country to exercise that high function.”</p>

<p>Saint Kebius, however, stands in the Roman Calendar
on the 26th of April; but the parish feast is kept (I believe)
on the nearest Sunday to the 25th of July, the day
of Saint James the Apostle.</p>

<p>This parish is one of the most fertile in Cornwall, as well
for corn as for grass. The church is situated in a pleasant
valley; and near it is Skinden, for many years the residence
of Mr. Joseph Bennet, a clergyman, but without preferment;
and after his decease, of Mr. Clode, a native of Camelford,
who having risen to the situation of a major in the
East India Company’s army, returned with a fortune, and
purchased this place; it now belongs to his sister Mrs.
Braddon.</p>

<p>The principal seat in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew was in former times Trewane,
the residence of an ancient and opulent family the
Nichollses. The house, partly converted into a farmhouse
and partly in ruins, appears in a style of grandeur quite
unusual in the houses of this county. It is believed to
have been built before the Civil Wars. These four descents
are recorded in the Heraldic Visitation of 1620.</p>

The granddaughter, or great-granddaughter, from these last

and married Mr. Glynn, of Glynn; but being left a
widow, and childless by the death of her only son, she devised
her estate in certain portions, to Mr. Glynn, of Helston,

<p>Stowe for many ages hath been the seat of that famous
and knightly family now Earls of Bath.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hals goes on with a long account of this family in

and quite unconnected with Cornwall.</p>

<p>I shall therefore select particular passages, more especially
as a genealogy in sufficient detail is given by Mr. Lysons.]</p>

<p><!--345.png--><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pageno">341</span>
It appears that the Grenvilles settled near Bideford,
where they are stated to have held knights’ fees under the
Crown, and also under the honour of Gloucester; and
Sir Theobald Grenville in the latter part of the reign
of King Edward the Third, was the principal founder
and promoter of building the bridge at Bideford; John
Grandison was then Lord Bishop of Exeter, who caused it
to be proclaimed in his Cathedral, and throughout all other
churches in Devon and Cornwall, that all persons whatsoever
that would promote or encourage such a work should
partake of all spiritual blessings for ever. Sir Richard
Gurnard or Gurney was then parish priest of Bideford,
who it seems was admonished in his sleep to undertake this
work, as Bishop Bronscomb was to build Glasney College
in Cornwall; the Goldneys, Octanetts, and most other
families of note in Cornwall and Devon (as Risdon’s Manuscript
informs us) were benefactors to this work, which
bridge was finished tempore Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, assisted by a bull
of indulgencies from Rome.</p>

<p>John Grenvill of Bideford, that married Burghert, was the
first Sheriff of Devon of this family, 15 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, son of
Sir Theobald. Thomas Grenvill, that married Gilbert, was
the first Sheriff of Cornwall of this family, 21 Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>,
1480, also the first of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>, 1485, and probably the
first of those gentlemen that settled at Stowe, for at such
time as he was Sheriff of Cornwall, 21 Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, one
George Grenvill was Sheriff of Devon.</p>

<p>One Robert Grenvill was Sheriff of Cornwall the 2nd,
10th, and 14th Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> Richard Grenvill was Sheriff
of Cornwall 36 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> Richard Grenvill was
Sheriff of Devon 18 of Elizabeth. Bernard Grenvill was
Sheriff of Devon 38 of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Roger, younger son of Sir Richard Grenvill that married
Bonvill of Killigarth, who in the Mary Rose frigate, 37
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, 1545, commanded by Sir George Carew,
Knight, with more than four hundred men besides, after
<!--346.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pageno">342</span>
they had for several days fought the French fleet off the
Isle of Wight under the command of the Lord Dambolt,
Admiral of France, with great victory and success, unfortunately
afterwards as the said ship passed out of the harbour
of Portsmouth into the sea, by the neglect and carelessness
of the gunner and mariners, one of which had left the
cannon or ordnance untrigged or chained, and the latter
having left the under port or gun-holes open, by means
whereof, when the ship turned upon her lee, the guns fell
all on that side of the ship and bore the port-holes under
water, so that the sea in an instant abundantly flowing in
through those port-holes filled her with water, whereof she
sunk into the deep (in the sight of King Henry himself),
whereby the captain and all his men were suddenly and
violently drowned in the sea.</p>

<p>Of his father, Sir Richard Grenvill, the elder, thus
speaks Mr. Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, “he interlaced
his home magistracy with martial employments abroad,
whereof the King testified his good liking by his liberality.”
Again, his son, the second Sir Richard, after his travel and
following the wars under the Emperor Maximilian against
the Turks, for which his name is recorded by sundry
foreign writers, and his undertaking to people Virginia and
Ireland, made so glorious a conclusion in her Majesty’s
ship the Revenge, of which he had charge as Captain, and
of the whole fleet as Vice-Admiral, that it seemed thereby,
when he found none other to compare withal in his life, he
strived through a virtuous envy to exceed it in his death;
a victorious loss for the realm, and of which the Spaniard
may say, with Pyrrhus, that many such conquests would
beget his utter overthrow. Lastly, his son John took hold
of every martial occasion that was ministered him, until, in
service against her Highness’ enemies, under the command
of Sir Walter Raleigh, the ocean became his bed of honour.
Thus Mr. Carew, page 62. See also Baker’s Chronicle in
the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

Sir Beville Grenvill, son of Bernard, by Beville’s heir
of Killigarth in Talland, was a gentleman of such urbanity,
valour, and integrity in those parts, that my commendations
cannot make the least addition thereto, nor I think that of
a more florid or abler pen; who, as his duty obliged, engaged
himself, his life and fortune, on the part and behalf
of King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; and being first a horse Colonel in the
militia for this County, was afterwards obliged to head or
lead those soldiers he had raised in Cornwall, by virtue of
the King’s Commission, under command of Sir Ralph
Hopton, Knight, his General in the west, from Launceston
into Somersetshire, at a place called Lansdowne,
five miles from Bristol, where Hopton with the King’s
army met and gave battle to the Parliament forces under
command of Sir William Waller; in which engagement
Sir Beville Grenvill, Knight, charging boldly in the head of
his troop, was unfortunately slain, the 5th of July 1643.</p>

<p>Orcot, now Orchard, in this parish, was the jurisdiction
under which Kilkhampton was taxed in Domesday Roll,
1087; from which place, I take it, was denominated the
family surnamed de Orchard, now in possession thereof;
particularly Charles Orchard, gentleman, steward to Sir
John Rolle of Stevenston. This gentleman was sheriff of
Cornwall about the year 1703.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The following extract from Mr. Lysons’s Cornwall is the
best account that the Editor can give of the distinguished
family of Grenville.</p>

<p>The manor of Kilkhampton is supposed to have belonged
to the Grenville family from nearly the time of the Conquest;
<!--348.png--><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span class="pageno">344</span>
Dugdale says, that they were seated here in the
reign of William Rufus. Richard de Grenville, who came
over with William the Conqueror, is said in the pedigrees
of the family to have been a younger brother of Robert
Fitzhamon, Earl of Carbill, Lord of Thurigny and Grenville,
in France and Normandy, and to have been lineally
descended from Rollo, Duke of Normandy. It is on record
that Richard de Grenville held certain knights’ fees at
Bideford, in Devonshire, in the reign of Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> We
have not found any record of the Grenville possessions at
Kilkhampton of an earlier date than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warranto</i> roll
before mentioned; but it appears that it had at that time
been long in the family: they continued to reside at Stowe,
in this parish, for many generations, and frequently served
the office of sheriff for the county. William Grenville, or
Grenfield (as the name was at that early period generally
written), son of Sir Theobald, became archbishop of York,
and distinguished himself as an able statesman: he died in
1315. Sir Richard Grenville, son of Roger, (who was
himself a captain in the navy, and lost his life, as Carew
tells us, in the unfortunate Mary-Rose) was a celebrated
military and naval commander in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
He first distinguished himself in the wars under
the Emperor Maximilian against the Turks, for which his
name is recorded by several foreign writers. In the year
1591, being then Vice-Admiral of England, he was sent in
the Revenge, with a squadron of seven ships, to intercept
the Spanish galleons; when, falling in with the enemy’s
fleet, consisting of fifty-two sail, near the Terceira Islands,
he repulsed them fifteen times in a continued fight, till his
powder was all spent; his ship, which sunk before it arrived
in port, was reduced to a hulk, and himself covered with
wounds, of which he died two days afterwards, on board
the vessel of the Spanish commander. Sir Richard’s grandson
was the brave and loyal Sir Beville Grenville. This
distinguished officer was one of king Charles’s generals in
<!--349.png--><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
the West, and shared the glories of the successful compaign
in Cornwall, in the autumn of 1642; in the summer of the
following year he lost his life at the battle of Lansdowne,
near Bath. Sir Richard Grenville, who had been created
a Baronet in 1631, was, after his brother’s death, made
General of all the King’s forces in the West. He was an
active and zealous officer, and so particularly obnoxious to
the Parliamentary party, that he was perpetually the subject
of abuse to their journalists, who seldom spoke of him
but by the appellation of <em>Skellum</em> Grenville. During the
dissensions between the civil power and the military in
1645, Sir Richard Grenville was superseded and imprisoned
by the advice of Sir Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl
of Clarendon. That noble author gives a very unamiable
character of Sir Richard, who is represented as having
been in the highest degree oppressive, tyrannical, and unprincipled;
but other writers attribute much of this to the
personal enmity which subsisted between them. Sir Richard
Grenville died, in reduced circumstances, at Ghent, in
the year 1658, leaving no male issue; the title became extinct.
Sir John Grenville, son of the brave Sir Beville,
succeeded to the Kilkhampton estates: at a very early age
he had a command in his father’s regiment, and was left for
dead in the field at Tewkesbury. He was appointed Governor
of Scilly Islands when they revolted from the Parliament,
and was one of the chief instruments in effecting
the restoration of King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> He gave the living of
Kilkhampton to Nicholas Monk, and employed him to influence
his brother (the General) in favour of the exiled
Monarch; having succeeded in his negociations, he had the
satisfaction of being the bearer of the King’s letters to
General Monk and to the Parliament. In April 1661
Sir John Grenville was created Lord Grenville of Kilkhampton
and Bideford, Viscount Lansdowne, and Earl of
Bath. On the death of his grandson, under age, in 1711,
these titles became extinct; and the Kilkhampton estates
<!--350.png--><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pageno">346</span>
passed to his aunt and coheiress Grace Grenville, who
married George Lord Carteret, and was afterwards (being
then a widow) by King George the First created Countess
of Granville, with remainder to her son John, who inherited
that title and the Kilkhampton estate. On the
death of Robert the second Earl of Granville, in 1776.
that title became extinct, and the Kilkhampton estate
passed, under his will, to his nephew Henry Frederick
Thynne, second son of Lord Viscount Weymouth, who
had married his sister Louisa. Mr. Thynne was created
Lord Carteret in 1784, and is the present possessor of
Kilkhampton; the remainder of which, as well as the title
of Carteret, is vested in Lord George Thynne, second son
of the Marquis of Bath.</p>

<p>John Grenville, Earl of Bath, in the reign of Charles
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> built a magnificient mansion at Stowe in this parish, of
which scarcely a vestige remains. It stood on an eminence,
overlooking a well-wooded valley; but not a tree near it,
says Dr. Borlase, to shelter it from the north-west. That
writer speaks of it as by far the noblest house in the west
of England, and says that the kitchen-offices, fitted up for a
dwelling-house, made no contemptible figure. It is a singular
circumstance, that the cedar wainscot which had
been brought out of a Spanish prize, and used by the Earl
of Bath for fitting up the chapel in this mansion, was purchased
by Lord Cobham at the time of its demolition (the
house being then sold piecemeal), and applied to the same
purpose at Stowe, the magnificent seat of the noble family
of Grenville in Buckinghamshire, where it still remains.
Defoe, in his Tour through Great Britain, speaking of
Stowe in Cornwall, says that the carving of the chapel
was the work of Michael Chuke, and not inferior to Gibbons.</p>

<p>Ilcombe, now a farm-house belonging to Lord Carteret,
is described by Norden as the residence of a younger
branch of the Grenvilles.</p>

<p><!--351.png--><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
Alderscombe, formerly a seat of the Orchards, is the property
of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Hooper Morrison, nephew of the
late Paul Orchard, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Hartland Abbey.</p>

<p>Elmsworthy, some time a seat of the Westlakes, is now
a farm house, the property of Mr. Galsworthy, of Hartland.
The last of the Westlakes died in very indigent circumstances
about the year 1772, having been reduced to the
situation of a parish pauper. It is a singular circumstance,
that he was twice pricked for Sheriff after he was an
inhabitant of the poor-house. In the parish church are
monuments of the Grenville family, and memorials of the
Orchards of Alderscombe, the Westlakes of Elmsworthy,
and the Waddons of Tonacombe in Morwinstow. On the
monument of Sir Beville Grenville, which is surrounded
by military trophies, is the following inscription: “Here
lyes all that was mortal of the most noble and truly valiant
Sir Beville Grenville, of Stowe in the county of Cornwall,
Earl of Corbill and Lord of Thorigny and Granville in
France and Normandy, descended in a direct line from
Robert, second son of the warlike Rollo, first Duke of
Normandy; who, after having obtained divers signal victories
over the Rebels in the West, was at length slain with many
wounds at the battle of Lansdowne July 5, 1643. He
married the most virtuous lady, Grace, daughter of Sir
George Smith, of the county of Devon, by whom he had
many sons, eminent for their loyalty and firm adherence to
the Crown and Church; and several daughters, remarkable
examples of true piety. He was indeed an excellent
person, whose activity, interest, and reputation was the
foundation of what had been done in Cornwall, and his
temper and affection so public that no accident which happened
could make any impressions on him, and his example
kept others from taking any thing ill, or at least seeming to
do so; in a word, a brighter courage and a gentler disposition
were never married together to make the most cheerful
and innocent conversation. Vide Lord Clarendon’s
History of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>Sir Beville Granville was forty-eight years of age at the
time of his death, as appears by the following record of his
birth in the parish register at Kilkhampton:</p>

<p>“Bevell, the sonne of the worshipful Bernarde Greynville,
Esquire, was borne and baptized at Brinn in Cornwall,
Ao. Dni. 1595.”</p>

<p>In the margin, “Marche 1595, borne the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> day, baptized

<p>All the accounts and traditions of Sir Beville Granville
represent him as a hero bordering on romance, as the rival
of Sir Philip Sidney, and of Lord Herbert of Cherbury.
He fell, however, into all the political errors of that age, by
attaching himself to the existing form of Government, not
<!--353.png--><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pageno">349</span>
because it appeared, on the whole, to prove most conducive
to human happiness, but from some fanciful, superstitious,
or blasphemous analogy it was supposed to bear with the
Divine administration of the universe. Then he concurred
with those who thought it expedient and right to destroy
the resemblance, by limiting that which, on the supposition,
should exist without restraint or control; and entertaining
that opinion, he nevertheless endeavoured to prove by arguments,
and still more powerfully by his arms at Stratton and
at Bath, that no resistance could in any case be lawfully
exercised against the individual who happened to hold the
chief magistracy from the accident of his birth. Such glaring
inconsistencies were, however, almost obscured by the
splendour of undaunted courage, of disinterested generosity,
and, by adherence to principles honestly entertained, however
erroneous or contradictory.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to the memory of Sir Beville Granville
not to insert his letter to Sir John Trelawny, recently
printed in the Memorials of John Hampden, 2 <abbr title="volumes">vols.</abbr> <abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr>,
by George Grenville Nugent Temple, Lord Nugent, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 2,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 195.</p>

<p class="blockquote indent3">Most Honourable Sir,</p>

<p class="blockquote">I have in many kinds had trial of your nobleness, but
in none more than in this singular expression of your
kind care and love. I give also your excellent Lady humble
thanks for respect unto my poor Woman, who hath been
long a faithful much obliged servant of your Ladyes.
But Sir! for my journey, it is fixed. I cannot contain
myself within my doors, when the King of England’s
standard waves in the field upon so just occasion. The
cause being such as must make all those that die in it
little inferior to martyrs. And for my own part, I desire
to acquire an honest name, or an honourable grave. I
never loved my life or ease so much as to shun such an occasion;
which if I should, I were unworthy of the profession
I have held, or to succeed those ancestors of mine,
who have so many of them in several ages sacrificed their
<!--354.png--><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
lives for their country. Sir, the barbarous and implacable
enemy, notwithstanding His Majesty’s gracious proceedings
with them, do continue their insolences and rebellion in the
highest degree, and are united in a body of great strength;
so as you may expect, if they be not prevented and mastered
near their own homes, they will be troublesome in yours,
and in the remotest places ere long.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I am not without the consideration, as you lovingly advise,
of my wife and family; and as for her, I must acknowledge,
she hath ever drawn so evenly in the yoke
with me, as she hath never prest before, or hung behind
me, nor ever opposed or resisted my will. And yet
truly I have not, in this or any thing else, endeavoured to
walk in the way of power with her, but of reason; and
though her love will submit to either, yet truly my respect
will not suffer me to urge her with power, unless I can convince
with reason. So much for that, whereof I am willing
to be accomptable unto so good a friend.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I have no suit unto you in mine own behalf, but for
your prayers and good wishes; and that if I live to come
home again, you would please to continue me in the number
of your servants.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I shall give a true relation unto my very noble friend
Mr. Moyle, of your and his Aunt’s loving respects to him,
which he hath good reason to be thankful for. And so I
beseech God to send you and your noble family all health
and happiness, and while I live I am, Sir,</p>

<p class="blockquote">Your unfeigned loving and faithful servant,</p>

<p>With the death of Sir Beville Granville, in the moment
of victory at Lansdown, the splendour of this family seems
to have fallen under a temporary eclipse.</p>

<p>His brother is represented by Hyde, the partial historian
of these civil wars, as unworthy of the character supposed
to distinguish Cavaliers.</p>

<p>John Grenville, his eldest son, created Earl of Bath,
appears to have been rapacious and oppressive.</p>

<p><!--355.png--><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
But all this was amply compensated by the subsequent
conduct of his son and heir Charles Grenville, who served
with honour in the continental wars, and participated
with John Sobieski in the preservation of Christendom
under the walls of Vienna in 1683.</p>

<p>George Grenville, son of Barnard Grenville, brother to
the first Earl of Bath, is known to every one by his literary
attainments and by his talents for poetry. This gentleman
had the honour of being elected member for the
county of Cornwall, with Mr. John Trevanion, after the
great contest of 1710, amidst shouts of</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Grenville and Trevanion as sound as a Bell,</div>
  <div class="i0">For the Queen, the Church, and Sacheverel:</div>
</div>

<p>In the following year an hereditary seat in Parliament
was bestowed on him, with the appellation of Lord Lansdown,
and he was succeeded in the representation of Cornwall
by Sir Richard Vyvyan.</p>

<p>Lord Lansdown suffered imprisonment after the accession
of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and retired from public life. His genuine
works in prose and verse were collected in 2 vols. 4to.,
London 1732. He died, sine prole, in 1734.</p>

<p>The old house at Stowe was taken down by John Grenville
the first Earl of Bath, and a superb mansion erected in
its place, partly, as it is said, at the national expense; having
the internal decorations suited to the size and magnificence of
the exterior; but soon after the decease of his grandson
in 1711, when the property passed into a female line,
this house was taken down and the materials of all kinds
sold.</p>

<p>It used to be said that almost every gentleman’s seat in
Cornwall had received embellishments from Stowe. Mr.
Prideaux’ house at Padstow received an entire staircase,
and some carved wainscot has, by a singular fate, found its
way to Stowe, in Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>Alderscombe, in this parish, was for many years held on
lease for lives by the family of Cottell.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander Cottell, about the year 1720, having
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">352</span>
served his clerkship in Penzance, as an attorney, married
Sarah Phillips, one of the daughters of Mr. Samuel Phillips,
of Pendrea. There is a monument to her memory in
the church, stating her decease on the 7th of August, 1727,
in her thirtieth year, with the arms of Cottell, Or, a bend
Gu. This gentleman married again and dissipated his whole
property.</p>

<p>The church is one of the finest in Cornwall, containing
splendid monuments; and under, is a most spacious vault
belonging to the Glanville family.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth noticing that here, while he served the
curacy, Mr. Hervey composed his Meditations among the
Tombs.</p>

<p>Kilkhampton measures 7,234 statute acres.</p>

to Richard Bone, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who dying without being ever

Mr. Bone’s are, Ermine, a fess indented Sable.</p>

<p>Besides the church town there is one considerable village
in this parish called Bedock or Besock, after the manor
of which it forms a part.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt not only acquired the alternate presentation to
this rectory by purchase from the family of Mahon, as is
stated by Mr. Tonkin, but also the manor of Ladock,
which had previously belonged to the Carminows and
Courtenays. The barton of Trethurfe has passed by the
heiresses of Kelland Courtenay to the families of Poyntz
and Boyle. The barton of Nansaugh is the property and
the residence of Mr. Andrews.</p>

<p>Hay, noticed by Mr. Tonkin as belonging to Mr.
Richard Bone, came by purchase to the Hearles of Penryn,

it has fallen to Mrs. Stephens, of Tregenna.</p>

<p>The manor of Bessake was acquired by Mr. Francis
Tregian, son of the gentleman from whom it had been
seized, but soon afterwards it passed by sale to the Arundells,
from them by gift to the Moncktons, who have added the
name of Arundell; and finally Robert Monckton Arundell,
Viscount Galway, sold it in 1780 to the late Sir Christopher

however, little known beyond the immediate neighbourhood,
till the line of road forming the great communication

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This parish has but two villages. The Church Town
and an assemblage of small houses near the Point, and
called Lizard, or Lizard Town.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that the very extensive manor of Tretheves,
Lucies, and Rosswick, extends over a great part of
this parish, and into Ruan Minor and Grade: it belonged
to the Carminows, then to the Reskymers, and to Robinson,
by whom it was sold in 1768 to Mr. Thomas Fonnereau,
after whose death it was purchased by the late Sir Christopher
Hawkins.</p>

<p>Mr. Fonnereau came into Cornwall as an adventurer,
and chiefly for the purpose of constructing Lighthouses on
the Lizard Point, under one of the improvident grants
which were frequently made in those times.</p>

<p>A single lighthouse stands on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes Island at Scilly,
and three, forming a triangle, on the rocks of Guernsey.
Two towers were therefore built on the Lizard, that each
Point might be distinct from the others, and experience
has proved their utility to be very great. For many years
after their construction the lights consisted of coal fires in
<!--363.png--><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">359</span>
each lantern, after the manner of a smith’s forge, and
urged in a similar way by bellows; but the blowing could
not be always maintained, and when that had been intermitted

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of this parish is composed of serpentine,
which is generally of the red variety, with dark-coloured
and shining scales of diallage.</p>

<p>South of a line drawn east and west, a little north of the
church, across the peninsula of the Lizard, the rocks are
for the most part schistose, and are covered with a deep
soil, which is exceedingly productive.</p>

<p>The cliffs around this part of the parish are very interesting,
and if minutely scrutinized would probably throw
some additional light on the nature and position of the
<!--364.png--><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
serpentine. To this end it would be necessary to make the
survey from the sea, which could only be effected occasionally,
and under very favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>At Perranbonse Cove, near the church, the slate is a
variety of schistose diallage rock, such as has been already
described at Cadgwith.</p>

<p>Near the lighthouses the cliff is formed of a glossy decomposing
talcose slate, which has been called by some geologists
Micaceous schist, but talc appears to be the characteristic
mineral, as it is present in a distinct form
throughout the veins, with nodules of quartz abounding in
this slate.</p>

<p>At Hensall Cove the blue slate is much intermixed with
calcareous spar in various forms, resembling the slate adjoining
the calc shists, and blue limestones at Veryan, Padstow,
and some other parts of Cornwall.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Editor would take the liberty of adding that in this
parish veins of steatite run through the serpentine formation;
and that considerable quantities have been raised by
the late Mr. Wedgwood from some veins larger than the
others, and near the cliff. The soft and unctuous qualities
of this substance gave it the popular name of soap rock.
Thin veins of native copper traverse also the serpentine
formation; but never in sufficient quantities to bear the
expense of mining. In some places specimens of semitransparent
serpentine are found shot through by branches
of native copper, forming what has been termed dendrites.</p>

<p>At Kynans Cove the assemblage of rocks possesses such
an extraordinary degree of beauty and magnificence as to
render it one of the spots most worthy of attention on the
whole coast. The interest excited by the general effect is
heightened, on a more close inspection, by natural caverns,
and the intervals between the rocks are perpetually varied
in their appearance by the swell and by the subsidence of
waves from the sea.</p>

<p>This spot possesses further interest to a botanist by the
production of some rare plants. The asparagus officinalis,
<!--365.png--><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">361</span>
the beta maritima, the carduus acoulis, rare in Cornwall,
and some others.</p>

<p>Doctor Borlase records some instances of great longevity
in this parish, but such generally occur in all dry and unconfined
districts, more especially when they are somewhat
elevated above the ordinary level of alluvial countries.</p>

<p class="p2">A manufactory has been recently established for producing
ornamented trifles from the beautifully coloured and
variegated serpentine of this district, and with so much success
that vases have been turned in lathes, exceeding a foot
in height, and they hope to polish chimney-pieces on a
large scale.</p>

other estate came up to but Sheviock and Pawton, which
last however was valued at £120.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>There seems to be but little of importance connected
with this parish. The extensive manor of Lanrake is said
by Mr. Lysons to have belonged at an early period to the
family of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret, and in the seventeenth century to
have belonged to Sergeant Maynard, from whom it passed
by marriage to the family of Hobart, and from that to
Edgecumbe. This manor includes the advowson of the
vicarage; and the impropriation of the great tithes belonged
also to Sergeant Maynard, having been a part of
the endowments taken from the Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germans.</p>

<p>The church town is rather a large village, and the
church and tower are of the form and size common
throughout Cornwall. The church contains several monuments.</p>

<p>In this parish is another village, called Wotton Cross,
and part of a third called Tidiford, where a small river,
navigable for barges, and communicating with the Tamar
at Hamoaze, divides Landrake from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germans.</p>

<p>The facility of water communication has established
some trade at Tidiford, but it is chiefly remarkable by the
great quantities of Plymouth limestone burnt there for
manure.</p>

<p>The system of using lime in agriculture does not date
further back in this district than the early part, or perhaps
than the middle, of the last century; and it is supposed
at the least to have doubled the value of all the land,
and in consequence to have increased the population, improved
the country, and largely added to all the sources of
honest industry and employment.</p>

<p>Wotton, as a seat of the Courtenays, must have been in
former times a place of some consequence. It belonged to
the family of Blake, the heiress of which family has married

the person that officiates at divine service, who, as an eagle,
ascends up to heaven for metaphysical or supernatural mysteries&mdash;as
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Evangelist, whose similitude is an

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church of Landulph is situated almost on the margin
of the shore, and looks directly down the river. It contains
monuments of the Lowers, but it has one monument of
extraordinary interest, to the memory of Theodore Paleologus,
descended from the last Emperors of Greece, or
as they styled themselves in the single city of Constantinople,
Emperors of Rome.</p>

<p>A very ample account of all that can be collected with
respect to this personage, has been given by the present
learned and ingenious rector Mr. Francis Vyvyan Jago
Arundell, in a communication to the Society of Antiquaries,
in 1815.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the parish church of Landulph, in the eastern extremity
of Cornwall, is a small brass tablet fixed against
the wall, with the following inscription:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">‘Here lyeth the body of Theodore Paleologus, of Pesaro
in Italye, descended from yᵉ Imperyal lyne of yᵉ last
Christian emperors of Greece, being the sonne of Camilio,
yᵉ sonne of Prosper, the sonne of Theodoro, the sonne of
John, yᵉ sonne of Thomas, second brother of Constantine
Paleologus, the 8ᵗʰ of that name, and last of yᵗ lyne yᵗ
rayned in Constantinople until subdued by the Turks,
who married wᵗ Mary, yᵉ daughter of William Balls, of
Hadlye in Souffolke, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> and had issue 5 children, Theodore,
John, Ferdinando, Maria, and Dorothy; and departed
this life at Clyfton, yᵉ 21ˢᵗ of Janʸ, 1636.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Above the inscription are the imperial arms proper, of
<!--370.png--><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
the empire of Greece&mdash;an eagle displayed with two heads,
the two legs resting upon two gates; the imperial crown
over the whole, and between the gates a crescent for difference
as second son.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Paleologus dynasty were descended from the
imperial race of the Comneni; and the first of the family
was Michael Paleologus about 1270; to whom succeeded
Andronicus the First and Second, John <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, and Emmanuel,
who died 1425, leaving six sons. The eldest, John <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>,
who was associated with his father in the government
during his lifetime, succeeded him. Andronicus, the second
son, had the principality of Thessalonica, and died of
a leprosy soon after the sale of that city to the Venetians.
Some fortunate incidents had restored Peloponnesus, or
the Morea, to the empire; and in his more prosperous days
Emmanuel had fortified the narrow isthmus of six miles
with a stone wall and 153 towers. The wall was overthrown
upon the first blast of the Ottomans; the fertile
peninsula might have been sufficient for the four younger
brothers, Theodore and Constantine, Demetrius and
Thomas, but they wasted in domestic contests the remains
of their strength, and the least successful of the rivals were
reduced to a life of dependance in the Byzantine palace.
On the death of John <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, who survived four years the
Hungarian crusade, the royal family by the death of Andronicus,
and the monastic profession of Isidore (or Theodore),
was reduced to three princes, Constantine, Demetrius,
and Thomas. Of these, the first and last were far
distant in the Morea; but Demetrius, who possessed the
domain of Selybria, was in the suburbs at the head of a
party. His ambition was not chilled with the public distress,
and his conspiracy with the Turks and the schismatics
had already disturbed the peace of the country. He would
have supplanted his brother, and ascended the throne, but
for his mother and the great men, who prevented him.
His younger brother, the despot Thomas, also accidentally
<!--371.png--><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">367</span>
returning to the capital, asserted the cause of Constantine,
who was crowned emperor.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Demetrius and Thomas now divided the Morea between
them; but, though they had taken a solemn oath
never to violate the agreement, differences soon arose, and
Thomas took up arms to drive Demetrius out of his possessions;
Demetrius hereupon retired to Asan, his wife’s
brother, by whose means he obtained succours from Amurat,
and compelled Thomas to submit the matters in dispute
to the emperor’s (Constantine’s) arbitration. But
that prince refusing to deliver to his brother the territories
that fell to his share, Mohammed ordered Thuraken, his
governor in the Morea, to assist Demetrius, and demolish
the wall that shut up that country. Hereupon Thomas
gave him the city of Kalamata, in lieu of the territory of
the Skortians, which he detained. Immediately on this
event, Mohammed besieged and took Constantinople, in
defence of which Constantine was slain.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The dissensions of the two brothers may be considered
a principal cause of the fall of the Greek empire.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“After the capture of Constantinople, Mohammed
makes war on Demetrius and Thomas, under pretence of
recovering the tribute due to him from them as despots of
the Morea; but he is obliged to retire, and soon after
comes to agreement with them. At this time the Albanians,
Thomas’s subjects, revolt, and attack Pattras, a city
of Achaia, where Thomas resided, but are repulsed; they
would have been, however, ultimately successful, had not
Mohammed sent his general Thuraken to their assistance.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The two brothers again falling out, and endeavouring to
supplant each other, Mohammed takes advantage of it, and
in 1458 sends an order to the despots of the Morea to pay
three years’ arrears of ten thousand ducats tribute, or quit
the country. In spring following, he marched to attack
the Morea, and reduced Corinth, without using force. At
the first news of his appearance, Thomas, one of the despots,
retired to Italy with his wife and children; and Demetrius,
<!--372.png--><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
the other, submitted of his own accord to the Soltân,
who carried him away to Constantinople.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Such is the account given in the Universal History from
Dukas. The relation of Khalcondylas in the same work
is more particular, as well as more favourable to the character
of Thomas: ‘Prince Thomas having retired from
Pylos, repaired to the island of Korfu, where he left his
family, and set sail for Italy; at the same time he sent an
ambassador to know if Mohammed would give him a great
extent of country along the sea coast in exchange for the
city of Epidamnum. The Soltân, by way of answer, put
the envoy in irons, but soon after sent him back. Thomas
arriving at Rome 1461, was lodged in the Pope’s palace,
and had a pension of three thousand livres for his other
expenses.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Rycaut, in his History, gives a still higher character
of Thomas: ‘Thomas getting into the castle of Salmenica,
defended the same against the infidels a whole year,
when, despairing of relief, he escaped into Italy, where the
Pope allowed him a pension till the day of his death.’ Of
him Mahomet gave this character: ‘That he had found
many slaves, but never a man in the Grecian province
besides Prince Thomas.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“But Gibbon has a very contemptible account of the
ultimate fate of this unfortunate family. He says, that
Demetrius died at Constantinople in a monastic habit, and
abject slavery; that the misery of Thomas was prolonged
by a pension of six thousand ducats from the Pope and
cardinals; that he died leaving two sons, Andrew and
Manuel, who were educated in Italy; that Manuel the
younger returned to Constantinople, where he was maintained
by the Soltân, and died, leaving a son, who was lost
in the habit and religion of a Turkish slave. The elder
brother, Andrew, contemptible to his enemies, and burthensome
to his friends, was degraded by the baseness of
his life and marriage, and sold his title to the empires of
Constantinople and Trebizond to Charles <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> in 1494,
<!--373.png--><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
who assumed the purple and title of Augustus. And in a
note he says, from Du Cange, that the Palæologi of Montferrat
were not extinct till the next century, but they had
forgotten their Greek origin and kindred.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“So degrading is the account this historian gives us of
the remains of this celebrated family. It is a grateful task
to endeavour to prove his representation in some respects
incorrect and undeserved; as we shall then be authorised
to hesitate upon what he tells us as to the rest, and to put
a more liberal construction upon the whole.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“From the inscription at Landulph it is clear Thomas had
<em>three sons</em>: the third, called <em>John</em>, whose family, though we
have no particular mention of them, remained in Italy, at
Rome probably, and Pesaro, till the time of Theodore.
From the inscription it is also certain that this family was
not extinct in 1636, and perhaps some of the descendants
are still living in England at this moment.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The imputation thrown on the <em>Montferrat</em> Paleologi
certainly does not apply to this branch, that they had forgotten
their Greek origin and kindred; on the contrary,
the inscription proves, from the accuracy of the pedigrees
and the arms with the difference of second brother, that
the family of Theodore Paleologus, had neither forgotten
their Greek origin nor high descent, but still gloried in
them, and were scrupulously exact in perpetuating the same.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The names of Theodore and John occurring in this pedigree,
and continued in the family of Theodore, are still
stronger evidences. Camillo, Prosper, and Ferdinando,
were probably acquired on their connection with Italian
families.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“It would be absurd to make any conjectures as to the
history of Theodore’s predecessors, as we have no documents
to warrant any conjecture. If we hazard any
opinion at all, we may suppose, that when, in 1464, the
Venetians under Vetorio Capelli warred against the Turks
and attacked <em>Pattras</em>, Thomas’s former residence, he probably
joined them, perhaps fell there; and in the frequent
<!--374.png--><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>
wars which afterwards occurred between those powers, John,
Theodore, Prosper, and Camillo, were probably not idle
spectators, but joined against the common enemy, as well
from a recollection of former wrongs, as a hope to regain
some part of their ancient possessions. Indeed, their settlement
at Pesaro might have been whilst the duchy of Urbino
belonged to the Venetians, and in consideration of the
part they took in those wars.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Theodore Paleologus was born, we may infer from the
inscription, at <em>Pesaro</em>. Of his mother we know nothing;
his father was called <em>Camillo</em>. The time of his birth is also
uncertain; though, from his marriage in 1615, <em>then a
widower</em>, we may suppose him to be then about forty,
which carries back his birth to 1575.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Theodore’s removal from Italy, and settlement in England,
must have been either compulsive or voluntary. If
the former, it was probably either on account,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“1. Of his religion; or,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“2. From other causes.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“As to the first, the Paleologus family, from the time of
John <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, were reconciled to and in union with the Latin
church; and to this circumstance is probably to be attributed
the protection afterwards afforded to Thomas by the
Pope, perhaps through the interest of Cardinal Isidore,
the resident nuncio at Constantinople. But the Greek
church still differed very materially in many points from
the Latin; and though Gregory <abbr title="Thirteen">XIII.</abbr> founded a college
at Rome for the education of the Greek children in the
sciences and religion, (and here perhaps Theodore was
educated), yet we find him opposing what he called the
errors of the Greeks; and in particular, on his alteration of
the calendar he is much incensed against them for refusing
to receive it. And again, in the pontificate of Clement
<abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> we find him particularly anxious to reform the Greek
church, and much enraged at being imposed on by a pretended
embassy from the metropolitan of Russia, which
proved to be a forgery. If Theodore, as is most probable,
<!--375.png--><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
was still of the Greek Church, these circumstances might
have induced the Pope to withdraw the protection and
support hitherto afforded to the family.&mdash;But if,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“2. To other causes, is to be attributed Theodore’s departure
from Italy, it was perhaps from the rigid decree
of <em>Sixtus</em> the Fifth, (about the year 1585), prohibiting
foreigners from living at Rome, unless they brought a
certificate that they were able by some trade or profession
to maintain their families. If Theodore’s family were then
at Rome, and in dependance on the papacy, perhaps Sixtus
might enforce this decree to rid himself of a family whose
high descent he possibly regarded with a jealous eye,
recollecting the meanness of his own origin. Or, the
severe famine, which in 1590 afflicted all the ecclesiastical
state, might oblige Theodore, among others, to emigrate to
another country.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“If, on the other hand, Theodore’s departure from Italy
was voluntary, as is most probable, it might be from having
formed some acquaintance, either with natives of this
country, or with foreigners who were coming hither.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“About the same time that the Greek college was founded
at Rome, (and where we may imagine Theodore to have
had his education), another was founded called the Scotch
college, for children of refugees from Scotland and England.
Here we may suppose Theodore to have had some acquaintance;
nor is it unlikely that when the jubilee in 1601
attracted a vast assemblage of persons from all countries to
Rome, some one of these might have prevailed on Theodore
to return to England with them. In the same year 1601,
the Duke of Braciano, a neighbouring state to Pesaro,
came to England, or rather Scotland, on a visit to the
King of the Scots his relation. Did Theodore accompany
him? Again, we may suppose him to have volunteered in
the war against the Turks under Rodolph <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> in whose
army were many Englishmen, and in particular Sir Thomas
Arundel, whose namesake, and probably friend, Thomas
Arundel, resided at Clifton, the subsequent residence of
<!--376.png--><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pageno">372</span>
Theodore. Did he come over with him? If not, we may
lastly imagine he came here through Sir Henry Killigrew,
ambassador about this time to the Venetians or Genoese.
The connection between the Arundel, Killigrew, and
Lower families, give the most plausibility to the two last
conjectures.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“But whatever may be our conjectures as to Theodore’s
removal from Italy, we know that in 1615 he was actually
in England, at Hadley in Suffolk, and (then a widower)
married Mary, daughter of William Balls, of that town.
No traces of the Balls family remain at present, either from
tradition or otherwise, except the register of Theodore’s
marriage; and even here, Mr. Wilkins, the minister, who
has favoured me with a copy of this register, says that it is
too mutilated and imperfect to decipher accurately the
name of Paleologus.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The issue of this marriage, as the monument tells us,
were five children, Theodoro, John, Ferdinando, Maria,
and Dorothy, all of whom must have been born before
Theodore left the eastern part of the kingdom; for the
register of Landulph, perfect till the year 1629, makes no
mention whatever of the name. He could not therefore
have settled at Clifton in Landulph earlier than 1622 or
1623.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Clifton, a few years before this, in 1600, was the mansion
of the Arundels; but in 1630, Sir Nicholas Lower, a
Cornish gentleman, who married Sir Henry Killigrew’s
daughter, was living at Clifton. Between these two dates
Paleologus must have come here; and what is more particular,
he died at Clifton in 1636, at the very time that
Clifton was the residence of Sir Nicholas Lower.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have made repeated inquiries of the old people of
the parish, but not the slightest tradition remains respecting
him; and here again conjecture must supply the place
of fact. When Theodore came to Clifton, he came with his
family, for by the register it appears one of his daughters
married in the parish, and the other died here unmarried.
<!--377.png--><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">373</span>
There must then have been some connection either between
the Arundel or Lower families and himself.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“As to the first supposition, if it is probable he came
into England with Sir Thomas Arundel from the battles in
Hungary, we may suppose Sir Thomas recommended him
to Landulph, as from its vicinity to the sea and warmth of
climate, more nearly resembling the climate and situation
of Pesaro than any other place in the kingdom. In this
case we may suppose him to have taken Clifton for a term,
and as the house appears to have been originally divided
into two, the subsequent occupier, Sir Nicholas Lower and
Paleologus, might be both living at Clifton at the same
time, unconnected with each other.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The more probable supposition, however, is, that he
settled at Clifton from the connection that subsisted between
Sir Henry Killigrew (who, I feel strongly inclined
to believe, brought him to England) and Sir Nicholas
Lower. Sir Nicholas Lower married Sir Henry’s daughter,
and as they were now advanced in life, without any
family, the society of Paleologus and his children might
be desirable to them; particularly when we recollect that
this was the time when the Greek language was so much in
fashion in England, that even ladies studied it most zealously;
that Lady Killigrew was one of the learned daughters
of Sir Anthony Cooke, celebrated for her literary
attainments, and particularly her knowledge of Greek;
and it is reasonable to suppose her daughter, Lady Lower,
wife of Sir Nicholas, was brought up with the same fondness
for the classic languages; and where could she expect
to find so able an instructor as a descendant of the
first family in the Greek empire; or what place could be
more suited to classical pursuits than the retirement of a
country mansion, such as Clifton.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the 21st of January 1636, as appears by the monument,
Theodore Paleologus died at Clifton, Sir Nicholas
and Lady Lower being still alive; of whom the latter died
in 1638, and Sir Nicholas in 1655.</p>

<!--378.png--><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">374</span>
<p class="blockquote">“The Landulph register, perfect from 1540 to 1628,
has then a great chasm till the year 1649; and during this
interval all the entries that would have been probably most
interesting to our inquiries were made.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Some little time since I examined the duplicates of
parish registers, deposited in the room of archives in Exeter
cathedral; and after a laborious search among the registers
of two centuries, thrown promiscuously together without
arrangement as to either parishes or dates, and those
for the most part obliterated by the damp, I had the good
fortune to recover the Landulph register for the year 1636,
which had the following entry:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘Theodore Palleologus was buryed the 20th daye of
October.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“By the monument Theodore is said to have died the
21st of January 1636; from the register it appears he was
buried October 20, 1636. It can hardly be supposed the
body was kept from January till October, and the difficulty
is increased from the knowledge, that by the mode of calculation
in use at that time, the year commenced at Lady-day;
so that, if he died January 21, 1636, the 20th of
October following must have been in 1637.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The body, if it remained any considerable time uninterred,
would have been inclosed in a lead coffin; but this
was not the case, for about twenty years ago, when the
vault was accidentally opened, the coffin of Paleologus was
seen, a single oak coffin; and curiosity prompting to lift the
lid, the body of Paleologus was discovered, and in so perfect
a state as to ascertain him to have been in stature much
above the common height, his countenance of an oval
form, much lengthened, and strongly marked by an aqueline
nose, and a very white beard reaching low on the
breast.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Of the five children left by him, no traces remain of
two sons, John and Ferdinando. Whether they joined the
brothers of Sir Nicholas Lower, who were distinguished
cavaliers on the king’s side in the unhappy wars that distracted
<!--379.png--><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span>
the country soon after the death of Theodore, and
in which Major Lower gallantly fell; or whether the miserable
state of England induced them again to re-visit Italy,
cannot be ascertained.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Theodore was a sailor, and served on board the
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Captain Gibson. He died at sea 1693, as
appears by a will and power in the Commons, obligingly
communicated to me by Francis Townsend, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Windsor
Herald. This is dated August 1, 1693, and solely in
favour of his wife Martha. If he had any children they
are not named in it. The signature is Theodore Paleologey;
and though described simply as mariner, it should
seem he was possessed of landed estate, as there are four
witnesses, Charles Gibson, commander, J. Wright, John
Corneth, Richard Roberts.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Mary Paleologus died at Landulph unmarried in 1674;
and her sister Dorothy was married in 1656 to William
Arundel, the grandson probably of Alexander Arundel, of
Clifton. This marriage is registered at Landulph and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mellion, as solemnised in both parishes; the entry at the
latter is, ‘Dorothea Paleologus de stirpe Imperatorum.’
Soon after their marriage they settled in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick, an
adjoining parish, the registers of which having been accidentally
destroyed, it is impossible now to determine if
they had any issue, though it seems highly probable. They
were both buried at Landulph, Dorothy in 1681, and her
husband in 1684; and as some years after, a Mary Arundel
was married to Francis Lee, the imperial blood perhaps
still flows in the bargemen of Cargreen!”</p>

<p>The manor of Landulph is traced back to the family of
D’Alneto, from whom it passed to the Courtenays, and fell
to the Crown on the attainder of Henry Courtenay, Marquis
of Exeter, in 1539, soon after which it was annexed
to the duchy of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The manor of Glebridge has passed through various
families, and is now the property of Mr. Bluett.</p>

<p>But the principal place in this parish was Clifton. Sir
John Arundell is said to have built the house about the
<!--380.png--><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">376</span>
year 1500. It is believed to have afterwards belonged to
the Killigrews, as it passed in succession to Sir Nicholas
Lower and Sir Reginald Mahon, who married the daughters
of Sir Henry Killigrew. The former died without issue;
and it was ultimately sold with the other property of the
Mahons to Pitt.</p>

<p>The Lowers had their principal seat at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow,
and were eminent during several successions. Some of this
family were distinguished by their proficiency in science,
and by their friendships with scientific men. This has been
very recently made prominent in a work that cannot receive
too much commendation, either for the accuracy, the
ability, or for the industry displayed by its author. The

<p>The geology of this parish is precisely similar to that of
the adjacent parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clether.</p>

<p>The northern part is situated on that range of downs
which extends from Launceston to the British Channel.
These downs consist principally of varieties of dunstone,
which are sometimes felspathic; but in general they are
very siliceous, and even quartzoze. They are interesting in
an economical point of view, as containing extensive deposits
of the ores of manganese. A mine of this substance has
been long worked at Letcot in Laneast. The ores occur
in a lode or cross course of capel, running north-east and
south-west; the lode is about twelve fathoms in width, and
is composed of siliceous materials, or rather varieties of
compact felspar, in which silex greatly predominates. The
ore is arranged throughout the substances of the lode in
veins and branches. In the latter form it was originally
discovered, not many feet below the surface, and in such
abundance that it was obtained at a very trifling cost, for
the hardness and tenacity of the capel permitted the ore to
be followed in all its ramifications without needing support:
and the result of these operations has been to produce a
large chasm, with curiously irregular and indented sides.</p>

Lanivet; to the north Bodmin; to the east Fowey river,
between it and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow; to the south, Lanlivery.</p>

<p>This parish takes its name from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hidrock, and is the
church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hidrock.</p>

<p>This probably may be the manor that in Domesday is
called the Lanredock; and if so, it is one of the manors
given by William the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton,
with the Earldom of Cornwall.</p>

<p>In the year sixteen hundred and &mdash;&mdash; John Lord Robarts,
being disgusted on some occasion or other with the town of
Truro, left his barony-house there, and new built a large
one in this place, quadrangularwise, to which he added afterwards
a noble gate-house, and enclosed a very handsome
park, well-wooded, and watered by the river Fowey.</p>

<p>This noble lord was afterwards, in 1662, made Lord
Privy Seal, in the place of William Lord Say, deceased.
In Sept. 1669 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
but continued there no longer than the May following; and
about this time he received the honour of being made Custos
Rotulorum of Cornwall. In 1679, July 20, he was
created Earl of Falmouth and Viscount Bodmin, but he
kept the title of Falmouth only six days, when he got it
changed to that of Radnor. In October of the same year
he was made Lord President of the Council, in the room of
Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury. He was
twice married, 1st. to the Lady Lucy Rich, daughter of
Robert Rich, Earl of Warwick, by whom he had issue
Robert Lord Viscount Bodmin. He married, secondly, a
daughter of John Smith, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Kent, a lady of great
beauty, who, it is said, was to have married his eldest son
the Lord Bodmin; for which reason there was never a
good understanding between the father and son. By her he
had several children, the eldest of which was Francis Robarts,
a very ingenious man, and a great mathematician,
author of several small works. He was twice married,
first to Penelope, daughter of Sir Courtenay Pole, of Devonshire,
by whom he had no issue; secondly, to the Lady
<!--384.png--><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pageno">380</span>
Ann Fitzgerald, daughter of the Earl of Kildare, and widow
of Mr. William Boscawen, of Tregothnan. The said John
Robarts, Earl of Radnor, died at his house in Chelsea,
very aged, July 17, 1685, and was brought to Lanhidrock,
where he had constructed a vault for himself and family,
and was succeeded by his grandson Charles Bodville Robarts.</p>

<p>Robert Robarts, Lord Bodmin, his father, was much
esteemed by King Charles the Second, for his bright, lively
parts and ready wit. He was sent Ambassador to the King
of Denmark in July 1679-80, but died soon after his
return. Charles Bodville Robarts, second Earl of Radnor,
married Mary, the daughter and heir of Sir John
Cutler, by whom he acquired a great accession of fortune,
but no issue. He succeeded the Earl of Bath as Lord
Lieutenant of Cornwall, and he was also Lord Warden of
the Stanneries. He was succeeded by his nephew Mr.
Henry Robarts.</p>

<p>Trefry, that is, the house on the hill, (for bre, bray, vre,
fray, are synonymous terms, indicating a hill or a mountain,)
adjoins Lanhidrock, and was formerly a barton belonging
to the Trefrys of Fowey; although they took not
their name from this place, but from Trefry in Linkinhorne.
It now belongs to the Earl of Radnor, who keeps
it as a domain to Lanhidrock. The Earl of Radnor’s arms
are, Azure, three estoiles, and a chief wavy Or; the crest,
a lion rampant Or, holding a flaming sword Proper, the
pommel Or; supporters, two goats Argent, with a ducal
coronet round their necks Or; the motto, “<span class="muchsmaller">QUÆ SUPRA</span>;”
which coat was thus given by John Robarts Earl of Radnor,
but for what reason I cannot tell, since the arms of the
family granted to Sir Richard Robarts, afterwards Baron
Truro, by the celebrated William Camden, Clarencieux
King-at-Arms, were, Azure, on a chevron Argent three
mullets Sable, as may be seen in their house at Truro, and
also in the church.</p>

<p>Henry Robarts, the third Earl of Radnor, in possession
of the property when Mr. Tonkin wrote, was succeeded by
his cousin John Robarts, son of Francis Robarts, youngest
son of John Robarts, the first Earl of Radnor; and with
him, who died in 1764, the family became extinct in the
male line; and the estate reverted to a sister’s son of
Henry Robarts, who had married Thomas Hunt, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of
Mellington in Cheshire.</p>

<p>Mr. George Hunt, the eldest son of this marriage, resided
occasionally at Lanhidrock, and represented Bodmin
in several Parliaments. This gentleman never married,
and he was succeeded by his brother’s daughter, Anna
Maria, now (1834) the widow of the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr >Charles Bagnal
Agar: left with an only son, who has assumed the
name of Robarts.</p>

<p>It is obvious that all families, to whatever degrees of elevation
they may afterwards ascend, must at some period or
another have emerged from the ordinary fortunes of mankind.
At the time of the Norman Conquest, hundreds
started forth at once by successful warfare and confiscation;
others have risen or fallen by the chances of civil war,
favouritism, marriages, adventures, or speculation in
foreign countries, by professions, or commerce; these last
have recently been more efficacious for ordinary individuals
and families than force of arms.</p>

<p>The family of Robarts, illustrious as it has since been,
derives its origin entirely from trade, and that too conducted
in the town of Truro, now indeed, and for a century
past, a place of opulence, and connected with a productive
mining district, where several ample fortunes have been
acquired; but in the reign of the Tudors it could have been
no more than an obscure place in a remote province.</p>

<p>There is nothing known of any particularly fortunate occurrence
which might have heaped wealth on this family;
<!--386.png--><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pageno">382</span>
they probably accumulated patiently through several generations
from father to son, when the rate of interest on
all capital gave a facility to the increase of wealth unknown
at the present day. That the family made their progress
in the world after this manner, is evinced by the nature of
the possessions transmitted to their heirs. Extensive on
the whole, but instead of being made up of large masses,
like those acquired in feudal times, it mainly consists of
small pieces of land scattered over the country, on which
the successful merchant or dealer lent his superfluous
money on mortgage, and afterwards entered into possession
or foreclosed.</p>

<p>The first Lord Robarts, created a Baron through the
influence of George Villiers Duke of Buckingham, with
King James the First,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> who emerged from Truro, and
built or improved the house at Lanhidrock, and planted
in all probability the magnificent avenues, must have been
a man worthy of his high fortune.</p>

<p>The editor remembers the house, a complete square,
with a superb barbican in front, united to the house, or
rather castle, by two lofty walls.</p>

<p>These walls were first taken down, and then the front, by
Mr. George Hunt, which he replaced by green palisades.
This gentleman had the reputation of being a classical scholar,
and he travelled into the south of Europe, where Taste once
fixed her abode, and where she still lingers or loves often
to return; but according to all the opinions now entertained,
he never met her in his walks, nor profited by the
contemplation of her works. Perhaps in his youth the prejudice
had not disappeared which confined all the elegance
and beauty of architecture to upright pillars with horizontal
cornices, and esteemed the word Gothic as of the same

it was applied.</p>

<p>This parish was heretofore a complete impropriation to
the priory at Bodmin, in respect to small tithes as well as
the great; and being situated so near the monastery, it was
<!--387.png--><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pageno">383</span>
probably served from thence, and considered as exempt
from the canon enjoining the residence of some spiritual
person on all benefices, and it has continued a donative to
the present time. Mr. Tonkin conjectures that the parish
is dedicated to a Saint Hydrock, or Hidrock. No such
name is to be found; but it may belong to the list of missionaries.</p>

<p>The Editor remembers to have heard as facts, from an
old lady of Bodmin, who died many years before the
words ‘political economy,’ were pronounced in England,
that the last Lord Radnor kept house at Lanhidrock in the
style of ancient baronial magnificence; that a bullock was
killed every week, and a sheep every day; and that whatever
remained over-night of meat, of broken bread, or of
certain allowed quantities of beer, were on the morning
distributed at the gate; and that in consequence the whole
neighbourhood became idle, depraved, and vicious, to such
a degree as to force itself on the notice of every one, and
to produce a full conviction of the utter destruction that
must ensue if it were possible that such mistaken liberality
could be common.</p>

<p>The manor of Lanhidrock belonged in former times to
the Glynns, of Glynn. Mr. Lysons says that it passed from
them as a marriage portion to the family of Lyttleton, and
from them by a heiress to Trenance; and that in the year
1620 Lyttleton Trenance, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> sold it to Sir Richard Roberts,
afterwards created Lord Truro. Mr. Tonkin has
stated that this gentleman built the house; but the whole
place has the appearance of much greater antiquity: that
he improved and decorated the building, and perhaps added
the barbican and the connecting walls, is very probable.</p>

<p>Lanhidrock measures 1659 statute acres.</p>

<p>In treating of the estates of this parish, I shall begin
with Tremere, the great town, called in Domesday
book Tremer, being one of the numerous manors in this
county given by William the Conqueror to his half brother,
Robert Earl of Morton, with the Earldom of Cornwall.
Mr. Carew calls it Tremore.</p>

<p>It had formerly owners of the same name, who, I suppose,
held it in vassalage under the Earls of Cornwall;
<!--389.png--><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pageno">385</span>
they gave for their arms, Argent, three reap-hooks conjoined
in the blades Sable. The last of whom was John
Tremere, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of this place, who left two daughters and
heirs; Alice, married to Geoffrey <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, of Clowance,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> which Alice, as appears by the inscription on her husband’s
tomb-stone in Crowan church, died the 1st of
May 1400.</p>

<p>And …</p>

<p>This place hath been for several generations the seat of
the Courtenays, whom I take to be a younger branch of
those of Trethurfe, to whom they have at length been
heirs; for the present owner’s grandfather, Humphry
Courtenay, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> during many years, and up to his decease,
Representative in Parliament for the borough of
Michell, married the daughter of Sir Peter Courtenay, of
Trethurfe, and eventually sole heiress to her brother William
Courtenay.</p>

<p>Their son, William Courtenay, married the daughter of
&mdash;&mdash; Kelland, of Peynsford in Devonshire, and their son
Kelland Courtenay, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> is the present possessor, 1734;
Member of Parliament for Truro; he has two daughters,
both as yet unmarried.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>On the decease of Mr. Charles Courtenay, son of the
last-mentioned Kelland Courtenay in 1761, all the property
devolved on his two sisters; one of whom married
William Poyntz, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Berkshire, and the other Edmund
Boyle, Earl of Cork.</p>

<p>Tremere, with much of the other property, has been
sold; and Mr. William Stephen Poyntz has acquired the
Boyle share of what remains.</p>

<p>This extensive parish contains several villages. The
Church Town, Bodwanick, Bokiddick, Lamorick, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Inganger,
Trebell, Tregullan, Tremoore, and Woodly, with
<!--390.png--><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pageno">386</span>
a part of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, the locality of an ancient incorporated
lazar-house.</p>

<p>The church and tower may be considered as handsome
models of western ecclesiastic architecture, where all are
superior to the average of other districts. This tower, as
well as the adjoining one of Roach, are without the usual
ornament of pinnacles.</p>

<p>In the church are some monuments; one to the memory
of Mr. Richard Courtenay and Thomasin his wife,
dated in 1632, is remarkable for its simplicity and quaintness
of its inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">They lived and died both in Tremere,</div>
  <div class="i0">God hath their souls, their bones lie here;</div>
  <div class="i0">Richard with Thomsen his loved wife,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lived sixty-one years&mdash;then ended life.</div>
</div>

<p>The advowson of this parish was purchased about the
middle of the last century by Mr. Phillipps, a substantial
yeoman of Roach; and the Editor has heard for a thousand
pounds. It now belongs to his great-grandson, the
Reverend William Phillipps, who is the Rector.</p>

<p>This parish possesses the curious and interesting remains
of a convent or female monastery, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Bennet.</p>

<p>Very little is known of its history. The remote, and in
former times almost inaccessible, situation of Cornwall, and
perhaps the frequent insurrections during the reign of
Henry the Seventh and of Edward the Sixth, have involved
the history of its religious institution in a greater
obscurity than what hangs over any other part of England.</p>

<p>This nunnery is believed to have been a cell to some
foreign convent; and it is not certainly known whether it
was entirely suppressed by Henry the Fifth, or whether, as
some have conjectured, it became attached to the priory of
Bodmin, and remained a parcel of that house till the general
dissolution.</p>

<p>It belonged for a considerable period to the Courtenays
<!--391.png--><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span class="pageno">387</span>
of Tremere, and in a state of repair, for there is a tradition
of its having made some defence in the great Civil
War, till cannon were used against it.</p>

<p>It was sold in the year 1710; and about ten years afterwards
became the property of Mr. Grose, a farmer of the
parish. His son or grandson, about the year 1775, built a
new house on the farm, when some remains of a beautiful
cloister, which the Editor faintly remembers, afforded a
ready supply of materials. It is said, that Mr. George
Hunt, of Lanhidrock, more impressed by the elegance of
these ruins than by the splendour of his own house, interfered
to the extent of remonstrance for their preservation;
but when the proprietor replied that he would willingly
spare them, if the difference of expense for getting stone
from a neighbouring quarry were paid him, nothing further
was done.</p>

<p>The mere site of the building has been purchased
within twenty years by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Francis Vyvyan Jago
Arundell, Rector of Landulph; and in the present year
this sequestered spot&mdash;scarcely visible in any direction at
the distance of half a mile, inclosed in a deep vale, and
surrounded by trees more lofty than its half-ruined tower;
the appropriate retreat of those who choose their lot<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="unindent">&mdash;is by the progress of recent improvement laid open to
public view, and above all to the inspection of strangers.
A hill so steep as to be dangerous for carriages, and extending
to a mile in length, has been avoided, by conducting
the London road through this valley, which, after an
interval, perhaps, of a thousand years from the time when
it was devoted to superstitious observances, directly opposed
to the benevolence inseparable from the Author of
all Good, and congenial only to the demon of evil, has at
last become subservient to general utility.</p>

<p>This parish is possessed of certain lands, some within its
<!--392.png--><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pageno">388</span>
own limits, but others at considerable distances in other
parishes. These are held by twelve feoffees, called the
twelve men of the parish, a species of select vestry, which
existed in all large parishes in Cornwall down to the early
part of the last century, till it was tacitly done away by
those improvident or insane acts of the legislature, made no
doubt in conformity with the existing prejudices of the
times, which have generated a rapidly increasing tribe of
lazzaroni, threatening, if their progress cannot now be
checked, most infallibly to reduce this once flourishing
country, the favoured seat of arts, of science, of morals,
and of legitimate refinement, to a state of vice and of degradation,
worse than that of savages in their primeval condition
of wandering hunters.</p>

<p>The rents are applied to the support of a school, and
to some specific charities, and the surplus given in aid of
the poor rate.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that these lands belonged to Credys
in Padstow, a cell to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bennet’s. This does not, however,
seem to be very probable, considering the nature of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bennet’s foundation. It is more likely that the lands
were the immediate possession of this convent; and no such
place as Credys is noticed by Tanner.</p>

<p>The history of Lanivet would here close, but the Editor
hopes that he may be allowed to bestow a few lines on
the Reverend John Lake, Rector of this parish more than
thirty years; possessed of learning, piety, and benevolence,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">In wit a man, simplicity a child.</div>
</div>

<p>He was educated in Truro, according to a custom evidently
derived from Catholic times, in the acquirement of some
classical knowledge, and then placed in an inferior line of business
at Leskeard, where at that period resided Mr. Heydon
as schoolmaster, an ornament to his country by every
species of learning and of acquirement. Here Mr. Lake,
forgetful of his having married early in life, and of a
growing family, devoted his time to assisting Mr. Heydon,
and in obtaining knowledge from his conversation, till on
<!--393.png--><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pageno">389</span>
a sudden he found himself deprived of his wife, left with
two daughters, and his business failed.</p>

<p>Thus circumstanced, Mr. Lake placed the two daughters
with his father; and having collected a hundred and thirty
pounds, he proceeded to Oxford, became a member of
Magdalen Hall, and contrived, on this scanty supply, to
keep terms and to obtain orders. He then returned into
Cornwall, served the curacy of Roach, and there married
the daughter or sister of Mr. Phillipps, who had purchased
the advowson of Lanivet; and a vacancy occurring in the
course of a few years, he obtained the rectory.</p>

<p>Here he again became a widower, and married a third
time Miss Bridget Hoblin, of Bodmin, by whom he had
two sons. The eldest became a Fellow of Wadham, and
the other of Exeter College. Both his daughters were
dead; and in May 1805, Mr. Lake departed this life, having
completed his 76th year, in peace with all men, having
been pious without fanaticism, and to the utmost of his
power, a practiser of the good doctrines which he taught.</p>

<p>His widow was left with a competence; and his sons
were advanced by their merits and their talents into situations
at once honourable and lucrative; but permanent
happiness in this world was not to be their lot. William
went to sea, and was lost with Admiral Reynolds in a first
rate ship of the line; and the second, after struggling with
a consumption, expired in his mother’s arms.</p>

<p>Lanivet measures 4690 statute acres.</p>

<p>The southern part of the parish reposes on granite; and
proceeding northward, the next portion is composed of
<!--394.png--><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pageno">390</span>
rocks of the porphyritic series, which are again succeeded
by those of the calcareous series. The middle portion is
by far the most extensive, the other two occupying only a
narrow part, on the extreme southern and northern parts
of the parish. The middle, or porphyritic series, presents
the most interesting phenomena.</p>

<p>Lanivet Hill is covered with large boulders and projecting
torrs of massive rock, which have the appearance of
granite; but on examination it proves to be a felspar rock.
The greater part of this hill is composed of lamellar and
slatey varieties of the same kind of rock, as may be seen in
the rubbish of the numerous shafts that occur on the side
of this hill. On the road to Bodmin, near the boundary of
the parish, is a very interesting elvan course. The upper
part of it is completely decomposed, resembling a mass of
prepared China clay; the perfect rock is a greenish yellow
compact felspar, with disseminated grains of quartz; it
bears the same relation to the porcelainous granite of this
and of the adjoining parishes, that the hard porphyritic
elvans do to the common Cornish granite, near which they
generally occur.</p>

The name Lanlivery signifies the church of bucks; for
livrou in Cornish is the plural of levar, or livar, a buck;
but for what reason I cannot so much as guess. This parish
is sometimes called Lanvorch, the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vorch,
to whom it is dedicated.</p>

<p>It is a vicarage, valued in the King’s books at 13<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>
The patron, Walter Kendall, of Pelyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; the incumbent,
his father, Mr. Archdeacon Nicholas Kendall.</p>

<p>In 1291, the 20th of <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> this church was valued at
9<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 11<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> for the rectory, and the vicarage at 15<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> being
the appropriate to the priory of Trewardreath.</p>

<p>Since the writing of the above I have thought upon another
etymology, which I believe to be the true one; that
this name is no other than a softening of Lan-le-Vorch,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vorch’s church-place, which is a very easy and natural
alteration.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church and <a name="tower" id="tower"></a>town of Llanlivery are very conspicuous
objects for miles round, and especially from the Plymouth
or great southern road.</p>

<p>The church contains various monuments to the family of
Kendall. This family were originally of Treworgy, in the
parish of Dulo, but have long resided at Pelyn, in this
parish. The house is beautifully situated in a small
wooded valley, joining in a transverse course the river
Fowey, about a mile below Lestwithiel. There appears to
be a vague tradition of some religious establishment having
existed here, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Chad, or Ceada, the patron
of Lichfield, Worcester, and Shrewsbury. No trace, however,
can be found of any such establishment; and it is
probable that these tales frequently rest on no more solid
foundation that the casual residence of some monk or anchorite,
or perhaps on the dedication of a domestic chapel.
There still exists at Pelin a small summer house, considered
as under the protection of this saint; and an inscription
records the festivities and friendly meetings of four gentlemen
<!--396.png--><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pageno">392</span>
annually on the <abbr title="second">2d.</abbr> of March, to commemorate the
day, when, according to the legend, this Saint expired
amid a company of angels, singing hymns for the solace of
his dying moments, and for joy of such an accession to the
heavenly mansions.</p>

<p>The inscription is as follows, under a portrait of the
Saint:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Friend, within these walls <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Chad you see,</div>

<p>The glory of this parish, however, is Restormel Castle,
but these buildings have been so amply described by almost
every writer on Cornish antiquities, that it would be idle to
repeat what has been so often done. It presents one of the
finest objects in the whole country.</p>

<p>Richard, King of the Romans, is believed to have kept
court here, and in his more commodious habitation at
Lestwithiel, and he was the last who exercised even the
semblance of independent authority. The earldom and
dukedom of Cornwall have, since his time, done no more
than afford a revenue and bestow a name, like the shadows
of a shade, with which the private gentlemen, holding hereditary
seats in Parliament at the present time, continue to
decorate themselves, by assuming the verbal denominations
of offices extinct above three centuries, and which habit
alone enables us to pronounce, as applicable to them, without
a smile; but which offices, like the ancient earldom of
Cornwall, while they had any existence, conferred real feudal
sovereignty, proportionate to their different degrees.</p>

<p>The palace at Lestwithiel has degenerated into a prison
for the stannary courts; and that town no longer witnessing
the county election, nor holding any of its own, may
still boast of its being in some degree at the head of a duchy
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>There is a handsome seat almost at the foot of Restormel
<!--397.png--><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span class="pageno">393</span>
Hill now called, Restormel, but formerly Trinity. It
seems to have been built after leases of the park were
granted by the Crown. It has passed through various hands,
and finally into those of the Edgecumbe family, who have
been supposed desirous, up to very recent times, of acquiring
all species of property, and, most of all, gentlemen’s
residences, situated near Lestwithiel.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Francis Gregor lived here in 1790, when he
was first elected member for the county, and it is at present
held under Lord Mount Edgecumbe by Mr. Francis Hext,
a gentleman of ancient family and ample fortune, and universally
esteemed.</p>

<p>Lanreath is situate in the hundred of West, and hath to
the west <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Veep, to the east Duloe, to the south Pelynt.
This parish, in the taxation of Pope Nicholas, is called
Lanraithow, by Mr. Carew Lanrethon, and the same in
the King’s book.</p>

<p>Rhaith is in old British a law; Rhaithow the law; so
that it signifieth the church of laws, or of the laws, according
to this etymology, which I will not venture to say is a
true one, but it is the best that I can give at present.</p>

<p>This church is a rectory, valued in the King’s book at
32<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> The presentation in John Francis Buller, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by

<p>As I take Court to be the head place of this manor, from
whence it is so called, to have been the chief seat of these
Seriseauxes, I shall here insert what I find of them.</p>

<p>Richard de Seriseaux or Cereseaux, junior, was one of
the men-at-arms who had 40<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> in rent of lands 17th Edward
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> (Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139, Lord Dunstanville’s edition).</p>

<p>Richard de Cereseaux, I suppose father to the former,
was one of those that had 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum of lands or rent,
or more, 25 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, and was summoned to attend the
King, and to go into parts beyond sea.</p>

<p>Richard Sargeaux, son, I believe, of the former, was
Sheriff of this county the 12th of Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 1389.
This I take to be the same person with that Richard de
Seriseaux who sold his estate in the <abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> of Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> He
held lands also in Kelland and Kilkoid in the hundred of
Trigg. Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 126.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><!--399.png--><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pageno">395</span>
This Sir Richard Ceriseaux or Sergieaux, for he was
knighted, had one only daughter and heiress, called Alice,
who first was married to Sir Guy <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> and
secondly, to Richard de Vere, Earl of Oxford; and, thirdly,
to Sir Nicholas Throwley, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> By the first she had issue;
and the last Earl of Oxford of the Veres, Aubrey de
Vere, who died in 1702, quartered her arms, Argent, a
saltire Sable, between twelve cherries slipped Proper; from
whence I guess that Sergiaux was only by way of abbreviation,
their coat alluding to his name, <em>cerise</em> being in
French a cherry. This Sir Richard Ceriseaux must have
lived to a great age, since his great-grandson, Geffrey <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Aubin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall but ten years after
him, in <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 1399, or, I rather suppose,
that this Sir Richard Ceriseaux may have left a son, who
was the Sheriff, and that upon his death, without issue,
Alice his sister became the heir.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It appears from Mr. Lysons’s researches, that the manor
of Lanreath, with the barton of Court, passed from the
Serjeaux to Pashleys, Chudleys, and Chamonds, from
which last they were carried by heiresses to Trevanion and
Grylls.</p>

<p>William Grylls, of Tavistock, is said in a pedigree of
that family to have married the widow of Knight, and to
have settled at Court in Lanreath; perhaps this lady was
the coheiress of Chamond.</p>

<p>Their son, Charles Grylls, bred to the higher department
of the law, married Agnes, daughter of Charles
Tubb, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and by this marriage a very considerable property
was acquired in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, where one of
the painted windows, the sixth, had been given by the
Tubbs; but where their descendant the Reverend Richard
Gerveys Grylls has, with equal taste and munificence,
raised the splendid decorations of this church to a degree
of perfection exceeding that of their original state, although
<!--400.png--><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pageno">396</span>
they are some of the most curious and beautiful specimens
of the arts and of the piety of former times, that have
escaped the fury of passions excited by great changes in
religion and in civil government. See Mr. Hedgeland’s
coloured prints of the sixteen windows, with descriptions of
each, and the life of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, from Capgrove, 1 <abbr title="volume quarto">vol. 4to.</abbr>;
printed for the Author, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 6, Claremont-place, Brunswick-square,
and sold by Nichols and Son, Parliament-street,
London, price 2<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 2<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>The church, which is a fine one with a lofty tower, yet
almost obscured by trees, has a monument recording the
decease of Charles Grylls, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> on the <abbr title="second">2d.</abbr> of March 1612,
and of Alice his wife on the 13th of June 1607.</p>

<p>Their son, John Grylls, took a part in the Civil War,
as indeed every Cornish gentleman was obliged to do, on
one side or the other; for in Cornwall, which might well
have been conjectured likely to remain almost free from
actual conflicts, two considerable armies were routed in
pitched battles, and two still larger were forced to capitulate.</p>

<p>This gentleman was knighted by King Charles the
First on the field of battle. He married Grace, daughter
and coheiress of William Bear, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> A monument in
Lanreath church testifies that he was buried there on the
30th day of September 1649.</p>

<p>Their eldest son, Charles, resided on his estate in this
parish, and married a lady of the family of Mahon.</p>

<p>John, his son and heir, resided also at Court; he married
Elizabeth, daughter and sole heiress of Richard Gerveys,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Charles, their eldest son, married Mary, daughter of
Edmund Spoure, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Trebartha, but died without
issue. This gentleman sold the manor of Lanreath, with
the barton of Court and the advowson of the living appended,
to Mr. Buller, of Morval. His brother, the
Reverend Richard Grylls, held the living till his decease
in 1735; and succeeded his elder brother as heir of the
family property.</p>

<p><!--401.png--><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pageno">397</span>
His son, Richard Grylls, settled at Helston, where he
married Cordelia, daughter, and eventually heiress, of
Thomas Glynn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> descended from the Glynns, of
Glynn.</p>

<p>Their son is the Reverend Richard Gerveys Grylls. It
would be presumptuous in the Editor to attempt any particular
praise of this gentleman, universally esteemed and
respected.</p>

<p>The manor of Botelett is stated by Mr. Lysons to have
belonged at an early period to the family of Botreaux,
the last of whom, Lord Botreaux, died in the year 1462,
leaving an only daughter, who married Robert Lord Hungerford.</p>

<p>It has in more recent times belonged to the families of
Roberts and Treville. It became divided by coheiresses
of the latter between Trelawny and Cross; and the latter
half has passed to the family of Lethbridge in Somersetshire.
The manor of Treyer is also stated by Mr. Lysons
to have been the joint property of Rashleigh and Glynn;
but in consequence of an exchange to be now Mr. Glynn’s
solely; and that Trewen, a seat of the Dandys, and
Trecan, a seat of the Lowers, are now farm-houses.</p>

<p>Lanreath measures 4358 statute acres.</p>

de Mort. in Lanrethon, Kilgather, et Lansalwys. (See
Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 125, Lord de Dunstanville’s edition, quoted in
Lanreath). But however this may be, it is quite certain
that the family of Boligh had been possessed of property
here long before that time, for here lived John Boligh,
who married the daughter of Killigarth. He was succeeded
by his eldest son William Boligh, who by
Avice, the daughter of Richard Pentine, had issue a
son, of his own name, which last William, by Isabel,
the daughter of William Bodrigan, afterwards married to
Ralph Vivian, had issue one sole daughter and heir, married
to John Kelliow, who brought with her this manor,
which continued the principal seat of this family, although
they have sometimes lived at Lanleke in South Pederwyn,
and sometimes at Rosesilian in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey. Here they
flourished in good esteem, having married the heiresses of
<!--403.png--><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pageno">399</span>
Leveddon, Trehawke, and Trefusis of Landew, and
matched into several considerable families of this county,
until such time as Christopher Kelliow, of Lanlake, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
having first mortgaged it to pay the debts of the family, at
last sold the property outright to John Speccot, of Penheale,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; and this is gone with the rest, or with the
major part of <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Speccot’s estate, as he devised it by

<p>This church is situated on very high ground; and one
of the stations for the great trigonometrical survey was
chosen immediately by it. When the latitude and longitude
were determined, latitude, 50° 20′ 25.7″; longitude,
4° 32′ 45.7″; in time, 18<abbr title="minutes">m.</abbr> 11<abbr title="seconds">s.</abbr> west of Greenwich. Besides
the church town, this parish contains three villages,
Tregavethick, Tregou, and Trenewan.</p>

<p>The manor of Lansallas has been traced by Mr. Tonkin
to Mr. Thomas Long, of Penheale.</p>

<p>Mr. Long left three daughters, as has been noticed under
Egloskerry. One of these ladies married Mr. Charles
Phillipps, of Camelford, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Cornwall
Militia, and Member for Camelford. Neither of the
sisters had any family; and on a division of the property,
this manor came to Mr. Phillipps, who left it jointly to his
two brothers, Jonathan Phillipps, a Captain in the Militia,
and the Reverend William Phillipps, Rector of Lanteglos
by Camelford. The former gave his share of this manor
to his sister’s daughter, married to her relation Mr. Winsloe,
directing them to take the name of Phillipps; the
latter gave his portion to his sister’s son, Mr. John Phillipps
<!--404.png--><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pageno">400</span>
Carpenter, of Mount Tavy, from whom the shares
have respectively descended to Thomas Phillipps, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of
Landue, and to John Carpenter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Mount Tavy.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons mentions the manor of Raphel, formerly
Rathwell, which belonged to the family of Hywis, and was
sold to Speccot; and has followed the great manor of Lansallas,
to which the rectory is appended.</p>

<p>The manor of Tregavithick belonged to the family of
Avery, but has been purchased by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Joshua Howell.</p>

<p>The manor of Polvethan belongs to Mr. Rashleigh, of
Menabilly.</p>

<p>The most remarkable place, situated partly in this parish,
is Polperro, a small town lying on a cove, rendered secure
for coasting vessels by a double pier, and affording an admirable
staking for the fisheries. It was also distinguished
for a precarious trade, occasionally heaping great
wealth on individuals, but in general taking it away more
rapidly than it accumulated.</p>

<p>This is, however, at an end, or greatly diminished. The
situation of the place is romantic and wild, so that an excursion
from Fowey, along the cliffs to Looe, through Polperro,
is one of the most interesting on the whole coast of
Cornwall.</p>

<p>The rocks of this parish belong to the calcareous series.
A little north-west of the church a copper mine has been
worked; among the rubbish of which a fine blue slate is
very abundant, but which appears to differ from the rocks
at the surface, merely by those having acquired a red colour
from further oxidation of the iron. The strata near
the coast dip landward at an angle of about 45°, being
broken here and there by narrow gorges, through which
the rivulets flow into the sea. At Polperro the scenery is
very fine; and the narrow entrance into the harbour, which
seems to indicate some great catastrophe, is an object of
much interest to the speculative geologist.</p>

the Duke of Cornwall. The incumbent Dr. Lombard.</p>

<p>This parish is wholly within the manor of Helstone in
Trigg, so termed to distinguish it from that in the west
<!--406.png--><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pageno">402</span>
called Helstone in Kerrier, they both having the same
lord, that is the Duke of Cornwall. This parish is now
said to be in the hundred of Lesnewith; yet formerly,
when the three northern hundreds of Trigg, Lesnewith,
and Stratton composed but two, Trigg Major and Trigg
Minor, it was in the hundred of Trigg Minor, in which
deanery it is still reckoned as to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The manor takes its name from its once chief place,
though now but a village, about a mile to the west of Camelford.
Here, I suppose, the Duke had a castle; for
there were two parks, which, though now disparked, do
still retain the name. They are adjoining to this village;
the one called the Deer Park, and the other Hellesbury
Park, the walls of which are still standing; and the latter
of the two is of large extent, formerly well wooded, and
watered by the river Alan, being a place exceedingly well
fitted for country sports; and no doubt, when the Earls of
Cornwall held their Court at Tintagel Castle, this place
was in much repute, not being five miles distant from it.</p>

<p>These two parks are now held by a lease of three lives
from the Duke of Cornwall, by Mr. Nicholas Dennithorne
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes.</p>

<p>I next come to the town of Camelford, so called from
the ford here over the Alan; “called also,” saith Mr. Camden,
“Comb Alan and Camel from its winding channel, for
Cam with them implies as much.”</p>

<p>At the head of this river Alan is seated Camelford, otherwise
written Galleford,&mdash; a little village, formerly called
Kambton, in the opinion of Leland, who tells us that Arthur,
the British Hector, was slain here. For, as he adds,
pieces of armour, rings, and brass furniture for horses, are
sometimes digged up here by the countrymen; and, after so
many ages, the tradition of a bloody victory in this place
is still preserved. There are also extant some verses of a
middle age poet, about “Camels” running with blood after
the battle of Arthur against Mordred.</p>

<p><!--407.png--><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pageno">403</span>
In the mean time, not to deny the truth of this story
concerning Arthur, I have read in Marianus, mentioned
also in the Saxon Chronicle, of a bloody battle here between
the Britons and Saxons in the year 820, so that the
place may seem to be sacred to Mars. And if it be true
that Arthur was killed here, the same shore both gave him
his first breath and deprived him of his last. Harrison
also saith, that to this day men that do eare (till) the ground
there, do oft plough up bones of a large size, and great
store of armour; or else it may be (as I rather conjecture)
that the Romans had some field or castra there about, for
not long since (and in the remembrance of men) a brass pot
full of Roman coins was found there, as I have often heard.</p>

<p>To these Mr. Carew adds (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 288, Lord de Dunstanville’s
edition) “Camelford, a market and fair, but not fair
town, fetcheth his derivation from the river Camel, which
runneth through it, and that from the Cornish word Cam,
in English crooked, as Cam from the often winding stream.
The same is incorporated with a mayoralty, and nameth
burgesses to Parliament; yet steppeth little before the
meanest sort of boroughs for store of inhabitants, or the
inhabitants’ store. Upon the river of Camel, near to
Camelford, was that last dismal battle stricken between the
noble King Arthur and his treacherous nephew Mordred,
wherein the one took his death, and the other his death-wound.
For testimony whereof, the old folk thereabouts
will shew you a stone, bearing Arthur’s name, though now
depraved to Atry.” Then follows what is before quoted out
of Mr. Camden.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis, in his Notitia Parliamentaria, says, Camelford
was created a borough by Richard Earl of Cornwall,
who, when King of the Romans, by his charter made this
place a free borough, and granted the burgesses a Friday
market, and a fair on the eve, day, and morrow of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithin, all which liberties were confirmed by his brother
King Henry the Third, by his charter, dated at Westminster
June the 12th, 1259, and in the 44th year of his reign,
<!--408.png--><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pageno">404</span>
as appears from an inspeximus in Queen Mary’s time, of
confirmation of liberties to Camelford, in whose reign this
poor borough was encouraged to send burgesses to Parliament,
which it had begun to do in the preceding reign
of Edward the Sixth. The present charter of incorporation
is said to be granted by King Charles the First; and
the manor of the borough to be held by the corporation of
the duchy of Cornwall to which it belongs. It is governed
by a mayor and eight burgesses or aldermen, who with ten
freemen, elect the members of Parliament.</p>

<p>The corporation, which is doubtless ancient, enjoys the
tolls of the markets and fairs, with an estate also of 15<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
per annum, which helps to support the dignity of otherwise
a very mean magistracy. All these revenues are reputed
worth about 80<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum. The seal of arms pretended
to by this town, seems to be in imitation of the
device of Oxford, for as the arms of that city are an ox
passant over a river, so this has a camel.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is only one street of ordinary building, of not above
fifty or sixty houses, all of which are in the parish of Lanteglos;
to the church of which place, distant about a mile,
the inhabitants repair to hear divine service. There was
formerly a chapel, which is reported to have been converted
into a dwelling-house: it is not known to what saint
this chapel was dedicated.</p>

<p>Dodridge’s History of the Duchy of Cornwall tells us,
that the chief rent payable to the said Duchy by this
borough, is 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 5<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The manor of Helston in Trigg is of very considerable
extent. Mr. Lysons says, that the ancient site or barton
<!--409.png--><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a><span class="pageno">405</span>
of the manor is supposed to have been at Michaelstow
Beacon, called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Syth’s, where vestiges remain of a
camp. Besides the town of Camelford, this parish
abounds in villages: Fenterwarson, Fooda, Helston, Trefrew,
Treegoodwell, Tremagenna, Trevia, and Trewalder.</p>

<p>At Fentonwoon in this parish was born Capt. Wallis,
celebrated for his voyage round the world and the discovery
of Otaheite.</p>

<p>The right of voting for members of Parliament having
been declared by a Committee of the House of Commons,
reported on the 10th of November 1796, “to be in the freemen,
being inhabitants and paying scot and lot; and that the
capital burgessess as such, have not the right;” it became
important to acquire as much as possible of the property
within the borough to secure political influence; and after
various sales and transfers, Lord Darlington at last succeeded
in acquiring the whole.</p>

<p>The civil corporation hold the manor, mentioned by Mr.
Tonkin to have been given by Charles the First, in the
capacity of lord of the manor; but the freemen are persons
presented by the homage in the Lord’s Court. It is
almost needless to add that, when the whole property came
into a single hand, and that residence with the payment of
scot and lot were requisite to complete the power of voting
in one presented by the homage, the Borough became
what is well understood by the term “quite close,” and
that it continued so till its extinction in 1832, since which
the property has been sold in parcels.</p>

<p>When Mr. Thomas Pitt, of Boconnock, received in
1784 the grant of an hereditary seat in Parliament, and
it became necessary, according to the established custom,
to create an imaginary office for the purpose of bestowing
on him a new appellation, Camelford was feigned to be a
barony.</p>

<p>Mr. Macpherson, the author, editor, or paraphraser of
Ossian, represented this borough in several Parliaments.
This gentleman made a considerable figure in his day,
and excited universal attention, chiefly from his publishing
<!--410.png--><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a><span class="pageno">406</span>
what are called the Poems of Ossian. He is now perhaps best
remembered by his correspondence with Doctor Johnson,
who argued with the force always exerted by his mighty
genius, against the authenticity of this work; and Mr.
Macpherson, probably unable to meet the reasoning, attempted
to establish his case by recurring to a practice
almost as obsolete as the achievements of his supposed
heroes, which was by reviving the ordeal or wager of battle,
as the best mode of ascertaining truth; and with this
view, according to the modern phrase, he wrote a challenge
to Doctor Johnson, and obtained the following
answer:</p>

<p class="blockquote unindent">“Mr. James Macpherson,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have received your foolish and impudent letter.
Any violence offered me I shall do my best to repel; and
what I cannot do for myself, the law shall do for me. I
hope I never shall be deterred from detecting what I
think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian. What would
you have me retract? I thought your book an imposture,
and I think so still. For this opinion I have given my
reasons to the public, which I here dare you to refute.
Your rage I defy. Your abilities, since your Homer,
are not so formidable; and what I hear of your morals,
inclines me to pay regard, not to what you shall say, but
to what you shall prove.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“You may print this if you will.<span class="ss" style="width:2em"> </span>
<span class="sc">Sam. Johnson</span>.”</p>

<p>The living was held for many years by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William
Phillipps, whom the Editor recollects residing at Camelford,
and universally respected for his placid manners and benevolent
disposition. A handsome monument has been
placed to his memory in the church, by John Phillipps Carpenter,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Mount Tavy, his nephew and devisee,
which records his decease on the 20th day of April 1794,
aged 70.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillipps’s immediate predecessor was Daniel Lombard,
Doctor of Divinity, son of a Protestant clergyman
<!--411.png--><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pageno">407</span>
in France, one of those who were constrained to abandon
their country by the persecution raised in the name of
Lewis the Fourteenth, by a Jesuite Confessor to the King
and his mistress, the widow of a buffoon. He received the
early part of his education at the Merchant-Taylors’ School in
London, and proceeded from thence to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s College,
Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship, and took his degree of
Doctor in Divinity. But Lombard never assimilated himself
to the manners nor the society of England. He spent
much time abroad, and especially in Germany, where he
became known either to King George the Second, or,
what is more probable, as a scholar and a divine to Queen
Caroline: from them he obtained this living.</p>

<p>In Germany he most fortunately became acquainted
also, with a Cornish gentleman, then serving with distinction
in the army, but distinguished still more by his abilities,
learning, and taste. This gentleman (Mr. Gregor) frequently
received Doctor Lombard at Trewarthenick, and
carried on with him a correspondence on literary subjects,
which is still preserved, and appears to have been his chief
friend and main support in a situation of complete banishment
from all other associates of his studies or of his amusements;
for it appears, from one of his letters, that in
former times, he had been admitted a member of what
would now be termed a club, with several branches of the
reigning family at a German court.</p>

<p>All accounts agree in representing Doctor Lombard as a
man of profound ecclesiastical and school learning; but at
the same time wholly unacquainted with the ways of the
world in which he was destined to live, or with the discoveries
of modern science. Innumerable anecdotes were
current about him half a century ago; of these two may
serve as specimens.</p>

<p>He proceeded from London to take possession of his
parish, mounted on one horse himself and his servant on
another, driving a third laden with such articles as appeared
to be indispensible in a country where he supposed nothing
<!--412.png--><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a><span class="pageno">408</span>
could be procured; thus attended, he followed the great
road, then passing through Camelford, but inquiring in a
foreign accent for Lan-te-glos juxta Camèl-ford, he proceeded
nearly to the Land’s End without obtaining the
least information as to where his parish lay.</p>

<p>The other evinces that he had not condescended to pay
any attention to the general classifications of Natural History,
although Aristotle or Pliny might have communicated
a sufficient store of knowledge in respect to animals,
without his recurring to modern authors. Having observed
a hen surrounded by a large brood of chickens, Doctor
Lombard expressed his utter astonishment and surprise that
so small an animal could possibly afford milk in sufficient
quantity for the sustenance of such a numerous offspring.</p>

<p>He died at Camelford Dec. 14, 1746; and left a valuable
library for the use of his successors.</p>

<p>This parish measures 3562 statute acres.</p>

<p>This parish no where rests on granite, although it approaches
very near to it. Its southern part is composed of
massive schistose rocks like those of Advent, and is also traversed
by beds of elvan, which very nearly resemble granite.
Its northern part consists of rocks of the calcareous
series, among which are slates of an excellent quality for
roofing.</p>

The patronage in Mr. Thomas Pitt (late Mohun). The
incumbent was the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Henry Sutton, lately deceased.</p>

<p>The first place of note in this parish is the manor of Hall.
Hall signifies a moor, as Mr. Carew truly observes; and
so by its situation it seemeth formerly to have been. This
place was for many generations the seat of the Fitz-Williams,
a family of special note in this county. Gervasius
filius Willielmi Fitz-William, held five knights’ fees in the
reign of Richard the First.</p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Robertus, filius Willielmi Fitz-William, impotens Miles,
Coronator Domini Regis,</span> (Carew, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139, Lord Dunstanville’s
edition, <abbr title="Edward Two">Edw. II.</abbr> <abbr title="Anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> 1324), an office much
regarded in those days.</p>

<p>Sir John, son of William Fitz-William, and Robert, I
believe his brother, were two of those who held 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per
annum of land as rent or more, 25 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; and had
summons to attend the king in parts beyond the sea.</p>

<p>Sir John Fitz-William, mentioned above, had only one
daughter and heir, Elizabeth, married to Reginald de Mohun,
fourth son to John Lord Mohun, of Dunster Castle
in Somersetshire, whereof some of his ancestors had been
Lords, which John Lord Mohun died in the fourth year of
Edward the Third, leaving his grandson John de Mohun
his heir; so that I take John de Mohun, named among the
<!--414.png--><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a><span class="pageno">410</span>
knights 17 Edward the Second, to be the same with him
married to Elizabeth Fitz-William, and the dates agree.</p>

<p>They say that this Sir Reginald de Mohun, coming into
Fowey harbour with a company of soldiers bound for Ireland,
landing there, let fly a hawk at some game, which
killed it in the garden of Hall, where Sir John Mohun
going for his hawk, and being a very handsome personable
young gentleman (qualities which his descendants retained
to the last) the young lady fell in love with him; and having
a great fortune, the match was soon made up between
them by the consent of their friends on both sides. I shall
add no more of this place, than that it continued to be the
chief seat of the Mohuns till the reign of King Charles
the First, when they removed to Boconnock; some time
after which, Warwick Lord Mohun sold the barton only to
Mr. Kekewich, whose seat it has been ever since. Peter
Kekewich, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> his son, took to wife the daughter of William
Williams, of Bodenick; and dying soon after 1720,
left a son, now residing at Hall. The arms of Kekewich
are, Argent, two lions in bend passant Sable, cotised
Gules. The arms of Fitz-William were, Or, three bends
Azure.</p>

<p>The manor of Hall continued in the family of Mohun
till the general sale to Mr. Pitt; and Mr. Thomas Pitt
is the present lord of this manor.</p>

<p>Hall, from its pleasant situation, has been called View
Hall; but as this was an addition of latter years, so is it
now lost, and the place has returned to its ancient plain
name. Mr. Carew hath a long description of the walk
here (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 310), which is still in being, but much neglected;
and also of a remarkable fagot, or rather a piece of wood,
belonging to the Earls of Devon, and carefully kept here;
but this fagot is, I suppose, now lost. There is but little
left of the old house, which I believe was destroyed in the
Civil Wars, which may have inclined the Lord Mohun to
part with it.</p>

<p>Under Hall, and adjoining to it, is Bodenick; that is,
<!--415.png--><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a><span class="pageno">411</span>
the house on the water, suitable to its situation. It is
but an indifferent place, consisting of one long street on a
very steep hill, through which is the highway, and at the
bottom of it the passage over the river to Fowey. There
is but one good house in the place, and in that the late Mr.
William Williams lived, and got a good estate by merchandizing.</p>

<p>The manor of Lamellin, that is the Mill Place, from a
mill there, lies on the side of a creek between Bodenick and
Polruan. “At the head of this little Pill,” says Leland, is
a chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wilow, and by it is a place called Lamellin,
lately belonging to Lamelin, now to Trelawney by heir
general. John Trelawney, of Pool, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> married Margery,
only daughter and heir of Thomas Lamellin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> ever
since which this manor hath been in this family, who some
time resided here. The present lord of this manor being
Sir John Trelawney, Baronet.</p>

<p>The arms of Lamellin were, Argent, a bull’s head passant
Sable, the horns and hoofs Or.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church is situated between hills, and therefore but
little seen; it contains monuments to the Mohuns and to
others. It was rated in the valuation of Pope Nicholas at
10<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>There is a popular tradition, that in the year 1644, just
before the surrender of the infantry commanded by Lord
Essex, King Charles the First was walking on the terrace
at Hall, described by Mr. Carew, when a shot was
fired, which missed him, but killed a fisherman almost by
his side. The tradition adds, of course, that the ball was
aimed at the King by some one who knew him, but that
must be uncertain.</p>

<p>Polruan, a place in this parish, having some pretensions
still to be called a town, has been wholly omitted by Mr.
Tonkin, and probably was so by Mr. Hals, from whose
<!--416.png--><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a><span class="pageno">412</span>
work the greater part of Mr. Tonkin’s manuscript is
copied. This place is without doubt of great antiquity; and
seems in former times, when vessels required much less
depth of water than they do at present, to have been the
principal station in Fowey harbour. Pol means exactly the
same as the English word pool, and may possibly be the
original theme; Ruan has been ascertained in several instances
to signify Roman. Polruan is, therefore, in all
probability, the Roman pool or haven. This place, with a
small district round it, forming in some respects a hamlet
within the parish of Lanteglos, shared in the elective franchise
of Fowey, where all residents paying scot and lot were
entitled to vote till the act of 1832 swept it all away.</p>

<p>Tales are related of Polruan having been an independent
corporate town, and of its having sent Members
to Parliament, while Fowey was a mere village; but such
traditions are prevalent in all places under similar circumstances,
and they have not here any sanction whatever
from authentic sources.</p>

<p>The manor of Lancells. After the dissolution of Hartland
abbey, this estate came to Sir John Chamond, who
made it his chief residence. Mr. Carew says, he was a
man learned in the common law, and knighted at the Sepulchre
(that is of our Saviour at Jerusalem). He had a
park of fallow deer at this place, which Norden notices, as
I suppose the abbats of Hartland had before him. It seems
to have been to Sir John Chamond a country seat and a
place of retirement. He was Sheriff of Cornwall in the
20th year of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> and again in the 28th year.</p>

and 4th of Elizabeth. He received, says Mr. Carew,
at God’s hands, an extraordinary favour of long life.
He served the office of a justice of the peace almost
sixty years; he knew above fifty several judges of the
western circuit. He was uncle and great-uncle to at least
three hundred; wherein yet his uncle and neighbour, Master
Greynville, parson of Kilkhampton, did exceed him.
He married one of the daughters and heirs of Trevenner,
and by her saw five sons and two daughters, the youngest

<p>Nothing seems to be known about the foundation of this
small religious establishment.</p>

<p>Hartland is said to have been founded before the Conquest,
for secular priests, by Githa, the wife of Earl Godwin;
but in the time of King Henry the Second, Geoffrey
de Dinam, by the authority of that King, and of Bartholomew
Bishop of Exeter, and by the assistance of Richard
Archdeacon of Poictiers, changed the establishment of
Seculars into an abbey of Austin Canons.</p>

<p>The patronage of this abbey remained in the family of
the founder, Geoffrey de Dinam, till the general dissolution;
and the abbats were accordingly named alternately
by Fitzwarren, by Touche, by Carew, and by Arundell,
in consequence of their having married the four daughters
and coheiresses of the founder.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives a very ample detail of the descent of
property in this parish.</p>

<p>The barton of Lancells was leased by King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
to John Chamond, and became the seat of that family. The
freehold has been for a considerable time in the family of
Orchard. It is now the seat by lease of Mr. Joseph Hawkey,
in right of his wife, widow of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Cadwallader
Jones.</p>

<p>This manor has passed from the Rolls to Trefusis.</p>

<p>The manor of Yellow Leigh is the property and the
residence of Mrs. Mary Harris.</p>

<p>The manor of Thorlibear belonged to the Arundells of
Trerice, and has passed by inheritance to Acland.</p>

<p>The manor of Mitchell Morton, extending into several
other parishes, belonged to a family of Smith, and became
divided among coheiresses.</p>

<p>Two thirds, having passed through different hands by
purchase, became the property of Wrey J’Ans, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and
have descended to his daughters. The remaining third,
with the barton and the advowson of the living, having
been for many years in the family of Orchard, now belong

from Stratton. It has a handsome marble altar-piece and

<p>The manuscript relating to Lanceston is lost.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Lanceston is situated in the hundred of East, and is
bounded to the south by South Pederwyn, as likewise to
the west, to the north by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas, to the east by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephan’s and Lawhitton.</p>

<p>It is well known that this town and parish took their
name from an ancient priory and church here, now demolished,
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephan, being called by the Cornish
Lan Stephadon, the church of Stephan.</p>

<p>The present church is dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Magdalen,
and is not valued in the King’s Book.</p>

<p>As for what Mr. Carew says, that the Cornish men
called it Lesteeven, that is no other than an abbreviation of
Lan Stephan.</p>

<p>But before I go on with the account of this town and
parish, it will be necessary to observe, that, although Norden
(whose authority is indeed of no great weight, even in
the description of those things which he had seen himself,
and gives draughts of, which for the most part are very
erroneous) with many others, call this town, or rather
castle, here Dunhevet; yet it is most certain that the ancient
town of Dunhevet stood at about half a mile distance to the
south-south-west of the present town of Lanceston, in a
moorish piece of ground facing the west, at the bottom of
<!--422.png--><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a><span class="pageno">418</span>
the hill on which Mr. Samuel Line has built his pleasure
house and inclosed a bowling-green, (from whence is a
very pretty prospect of the vale under it to the east, and
the course of the river Tamar) being parcel of the commons
belonging to the freemen of Lanceston. I went on
purpose to view the ruins of the said town this present
year 1731, having before this been led aside by the vulgar
opinion, of which every boy I found in the town could
satisfy me to the contrary. On the place where the said
ruins appear are three wells, which I suppose are from the
same spring, being pretty close together; and are, (as I
take it) the head of that small river which runs by Tresmorrow,
Lanleke, Landew, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> below which it hath a
handsome stone bridge, and soon after falls into the Tamar.
So that the said town had, in this respect, the advantage of
the new one, as being well supplied with water, which is
much wanting in this last. By the ruins it doth not appear
to have been of very considerable bigness; though
indeed there be no judging well of it, by reason that all the
stones of any value have been from time to time carried off
to build the present town, and the rest employed to make
small inclosures of meadows there.</p>

<p>This place fell to decay, I suppose, on William Earl of
Morton building a castle, or rather repairing the old one
and putting it in the present form, in the beginning of the
Norman times; for, by tradition, this castle has been, from
remote antiquity, a seat of the Princes of Cornwall. This
William Earl of Morton being also Earl of Cornwall by
descent from his father Robert, who was half-brother by
his mother to William the Conqueror, drew over the inhabitants
of Dunhevet to this place, by granting great privileges
to this his chief seat in this county.</p>

<p>But before we go on with the history of this town, let
us see what Leland, Camden, and Carew say of it.</p>

<p>Leland.&mdash;“After that I had passed over Aterey, I went
up by the hill through the long suburbs until I came to the
town wall and gate, and so passed through the town, ascending
<!--423.png--><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span class="pageno">419</span>
the hill until I came to the very top of it, where be
the market-place and the parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephan, lately
re-edified. The large and ancient castle of Launceston
standeth on the knappe of the hill by south, a little from
the parish church. Much of this castle yet standeth; and
the moles that the keep standeth on are large, and of a
terrible height; and the arx of it having three several
wards, is the strongest, but not the biggest, that ever I saw
in any ancient work in England. There is a little pirle of
water that serveth the high part of Launceston. The
priory of Launceston standeth in the south-west part
of the suburb of the town, under the root of the hill by
a fair wood side; and through this wood runneth a pirle of
water coming out of a hill thereby, and serveth all the
offices of the place. In the church I marked two notable
tombs, one of Prior Horton and another of Prior Stephan;
one also told me that Mabilia, a countess, was
buried there in the chapter house; one William Warwist,
Bishop of Excester, erected this priory, and was
afterwards buried at Plympton priory, that he also erected.
Warwist, for the erection of Launceston priory, suppressed
the collegiate church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephan, having Prebendaries;
and gave the best part of the lands to Launceston
priory, and took the residue himself. There yet standeth
a church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephan, about half a mile from Launceston,
on a hill, where the collegiate church was. Gawen
Carew hath the custody of the priory. There is also a
chapel by west-north-west, a little out of Launceston, dedicated
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catharine; it is now profaned.” So far
Leland.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Carew is more particular (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 274 Lord Dunstanville’s
edition). “Those buildings, commonly known by the
name of Launston, and written Lanceston, are by the
Cornish men called Lesteevan (Lez in Cornish signifieth
broad, and these are scatteringly erected) and were anciently
termed Lanstaphadon, by interpretation Saint Stephan’s
Church: they consist of two boroughs, Downevet
<!--424.png--><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pageno">420</span>
and Newport; that, perhaps, so called, of down-yielding,
as having a steep hill; this, of its newer erection.
With these, join the parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephan.
The parish church of Launceston itself fetches its
title of dedication from Mary Magdalen, whose image is
curiously hewed in a side wall, and the whole church fairly
built.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The town was first founded, saith Mr. Hooker, by
Eadulphus, brother to Alpsius Duke of Devon and Cornwall;
and by its being girded with a wall, argueth in times
past to have carried some value.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A new increase of wealth expresseth itself in the inhabitants’
late repaired and enlarged buildings. They are
governed by a mayor and his scarlet-robed brethren; and
reap benefit by their fairs and markets, and the county assizes.
The statute of <abbr title="thirty-second">32d</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> which took order
touching sanctuaries, endowed this town with the privilege
of one; but I find it not turned to any use.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“To the town there is adjoinant in site, but sequestered
in jurisdiction, an ancient castle, whose steep rocky-footed
keep hath its top environed with a treble wall; and in regard
thereof, men say, was called Castle Terrible. The
base court compriseth a decayed chapel, a large hall for
holding the shire assizes, the constable’s dwelling-house,
and the common gaol.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“About sixty years past (i. e. about 1540) there were
found certain leather coins in the castle wall, whose fair
stamp and strong substance till then resisted the assault of
time as they would now of covetousness.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A little without the town were founded a friary, and
anno 1128 an abbey, furthered by Reginald Earl of Cornwall.”
Thus far Mr. Carew.</p>

<p>Having now done with what former writers have said of
this place, I come to give my account of it; and herein I
shall begin with</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE CASTLE.
<!--425.png--><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a><span class="pageno">421</span></p>

<p>This is seated to the west-south-west of the town, so that
you have a full prospect of it from the western road. Below
the wall is a large and deep graff, which formerly surrounded
it, and is still very visible on the western side; the
rest being taken up partly by the highway, and partly by
gardens and buildings, which on the eastern side come
home along to the castle walls. The west gate is in a manner
all in ruins; neither are there any remains of the
chapel, the hall, or the constable’s house, there being now
no other building remaining therein but the house which
now serveth for the common gaol; whereas the old one, as
the townsmen say, was over the north-east gate, which is
still kept in good repair, though no one lives in it.</p>

<p>At the north-east end stands the keep, on a high tapered
mount, which I once thought was artificial, though
I am now satisfied to the contrary, there being a quarry of
stones almost at the very top of it; though there has been
some art used nevertheless to bring it to the form that it
now has. A covered way formerly led you by steps of
stone of an easy ascent, to the top of it, which steps are
now carried off as well as the roof, and the whole in a
ruinous condition; and truly it moveth compassion to see
the woful plight of this so pleasant a seat, accommodated
with a fine park, formerly well wooded, with a small rivulet
of water running through it. The whole being now
held for lease on lives by Hugh Piper, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who by virtue
thereof is likewise constable of the castle and keeper of the
gaol, the which was granted to his grandfather Sir Hugh
Piper, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> together with the lieutenant-governorship of
Plymouth by King Charles the Second, as a reward for his
sufferings and exemplary bravery in the Civil Wars, in
one of the battles during which the said Sir Hugh Piper
was left for dead in a field for a whole night; being found
the next morning, he was put into a warm bed, and carefully
looked to. He lived after this to a good old age, as
<!--426.png--><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a><span class="pageno">422</span>
may be seen by the inscription on his monument in the
church.</p>

<p>I had forgotten to say anything of Mr. Willis’s account
of this borough, which I shall therefore now insert.</p>

<p>Robert Earl of Morton, and his successors Earls of
Cornwall, having their chief residence at this castle, the
town increased much in buildings and riches, and had certain
privileges and liberties conferred upon it.</p>

<p>There were burgesses inhabiting or belonging to the castle
of this town in the reign of King Henry the Second, and the
reign of King Henry the Third. The town was by its then
lord, Richard Earl of Poictiers and of Cornwall, the King’s
brother,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> made a free borough, who granted to it by his charter,
without date, power to choose their own bailiffs, who were
to answer the farm of the borough, which was to himself
100<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; to the prior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephan 65<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 10<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>; and to the
lepers of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard, of Lanceston, 100<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> of his alms.
He granted them also to erect a guild of merchants in the
said borough to hold of him and his heirs, which privileges
(as may be seen by divers charters and letters patent
of the Kings of England, reciting by inspeximus) were
frequently confirmed, and with additional liberties. And in
the 10th year of Richard the Second, upon the petition of
these burgesses, complaining that the last assizes and sessions
had been detained from them and held at Lostwithiel,
the King grants that these should be kept no where else
in the county of Cornwall but at Launceston.</p>

<p>This Prince’s father<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> had, on his being created Duke of
Cornwall, inter alia, the castle, borough, and honor of Launceston,
assigned to him and the heirs of his body, eldest
sons of the Kings of England, in whom accordingly this
manor has been vested ever since; and is now held in fee
farm by the heir-apparent to the Crown of England, being
by birth Duke of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, and eight
aldermen, who, with the free burgesses, being in number
<!--427.png--><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pageno">423</span>
about 130, elect the members of Parliament. Its present
establishment of incorporation is owing to a charter of
Queen Mary, <abbr title="Anno Domini">A. D.</abbr> 1555. At the last Visitation of the
Heralds, held on the 27th of Sept. 1620, the entries were,</p>

<p>Thomas Morton, mayor, Sir Anthony Rous, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> recorder;
John Genis, Richard Estcot, Arthur Pinard, Nicholas
Baker, Hugh Vigures, Henry Cary, George Hext, Orwald
Cooke, aldermen; and Philip King, town clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis goes on to say, That this was an ancient market
town, may be seen by the Pipe Rolls in King John’s time,
in whose reign the men of Launceston gave a fine of five
marks to change the market from the Lord’s Day, whereon
it was formerly kept, to Thursday, although it hath since
undergone a second alteration, and is now kept on Saturdays.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>No one can approach Launceston, and more especially
from the eastward, without being struck by the magnificent
remains of the ancient castle.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward King, in the third volume of his Munimenta
Antiqua, treats much at large of the fortresses
erected in remote times throughout Cornwall; and he particularly
dwells on this at Launceston, assigning to it the
most remote antiquity on account of its not bearing any
resemblance to castles built by the Romans, Saxons, Danes,
or Normans, and from its agreement with various of the
Phœnician, Syrian, and Median castles, and especially with
those in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Mr. King says, the keep (unlike all Norman keeps) instead
of being of great diameter and spacious, is very small,
although there was evidently space enough on the top of the
rock to have made it as large as Norman magnificence could
demand, had it been erected, as some have hastily conjectured,
by that people. It is only eighteen feet and a half
<!--428.png--><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a><span class="pageno">424</span>
in diameter within, and it is quite round. On the contrary,
Trematon, in the same county, which may with good
reason be concluded to have been built by Robert Earl of
Morton, is a true Norman structure; and there cannot be
a greater contrast than there is between it and Launceston.
Like Tunbridge castle, it is placed, not on a high
natural rock, but on an artificial mound, and is no les
than sixty feet in diameter on the inside. See Dr. Borlase’s
Antiquities, <abbr title="second edition">2d. ed.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 354.</p>

<p>The wall of the keep at Launceston is exceedingly strong,
being at least ten feet thick; and within its thickness is a
staircase, ascending up from one side of the passage of the
doorway, without any winding, excepting that of the mere
curvature of the wall itself.</p>

<p>The present height is thirty-two feet, the upper part
being somewhat broken down; and it contained, as its
only apartments, a sort of dungeon on the ground, which
had no light at all, and two rooms over it, one above the
other. The lowermost of these, or the room immediately
above the dungeon, was nearly as dismal and dark as the
dungeon itself, and appears obviously, therefore, to have
been intended merely to be used as a place for store, or a
sort of treasury; but in the uppermost apartment there
appear to have been two large windows (now broken
down) commanding a most extensive view, one to the east
and another to the west; and also a fire-hearth, with a
passage for the smoke carried up through the thickness of
the wall towards the north, all which plainly indicate this
room to have been intended as a sort of state apartment
for the actual residence of the chieftain.</p>

<p>Such is this tower; and its close surrounding works are
no less extraordinary, for we find it encompassed by a second
munition still stronger than itself.</p>

<p>About six feet, or a little more, from its outside, is an
encircling wall twelve feet thick, and nearly equal in height
with the floor of the uppermost apartment of all.</p>

<p>Beyond this second wall is again a second surrounding
<!--429.png--><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a><span class="pageno">425</span>
area in like manner with the first, only six feet wide, and
which was further inclosed by a third encircling wall, forming
a sort of parapet.</p>

<p>Beyond all these was an external wall with a deep ditch.</p>

<p>Mr. King then goes on to compare this castle with ancient
descriptions of those in the east, and satisfies himself
of their identity.</p>

<p>Respecting the name, Dun or Doon, is unquestionably
a hill, and thence derivatively a fortress; but no plausible
conjecture has been formed in regard to the second syllable.</p>

<p>A similar observation may be made respecting the name
of the town. Lan occurs as a prefix, in the sense of indicating
a church, eleven times in Cornwall; but it seems difficult
to derive “ceston” from Stephan. Yet if the Celtic
pronunciation of Stephan was really Staveton, Lanstaveton
may have easily glided, through Saxon pronunciation
and misapprehension of the terminating syllable into
Lanceston.</p>

<p>The priory of Launceston appears to have been a foundation
of no small magnitude. The list of its possessions,
in the Augmentation Office, exhibit a considerable revenue;
and Leland describes its church with handsome monuments:
not a trace remains. No one more sincerely rejoices
at the downfall of superstition, originating in ages of darkness,
than the Editor of this work, and above all at the approaching
annihilation throughout Europe of monastic institutions,
promised by the regular and steady current of events;
but the sudden and indiscriminating devastations of the sixteenth
century, sweeping every thing before them like whirlwinds,
destroying for the mere sake of wanton destruction,
or at the very best&mdash;from a desire of obliterating all former
remembrances; these stamp on the mind very different impressions;
and when it is felt that the storm was urged forwards
by the fury of an individual, by the avarice of those
occupying the highest stations, and by the purposely
inflamed passions of the multitude, it is impossible not
<!--430.png--><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a><span class="pageno">426</span>

however, exist in ancient transcripts; some, formerly
in the possession of William Griffith, and referred to
by Bishop Tanner, are now preserved in the Lansdowne
Collection. Among these the following document may be
found relative to the foundation of the priory by William
Warlewast, Bishop of Exeter, from 1150 to 1159:&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noscat

Launceston, defended by its Acropolis, and important
as a frontier town, probably remained in all respects the
capital of Cornwall so long as that little state retained its
separate existence. Lestwithiel afterwards became the
residence of its nominal Earls, took from Launceston the
sheriffs’ court, and acquired the technical appellation of the
county town.</p>

<p>The assizes, however, continued at Launceston, and
the quarter sessions were opened there; and then, for the
convenience of the western population, adjourned to Truro.
Here also was the only county gaol; till at last the inconvenience
and expense became so great, that about the
year 1780, a new, extensive, and commodious gaol, with
every recent improvement, was constructed at Bodmin,
where the summer assizes had been removed under the
authority of an act of Parliament 1st Geo. <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> c. 45, rendered
necessary by the charter of King Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p>But Launceston, only two miles from the boundary of
Cornwall, and so remote from the mining districts, which
comprehend the great masses of population and of litigible
property, as to render a journey there in one day impossible,
has been long considered wholly unfitted for the holding
of any court having jurisdiction thoughout the county;
while on the other hand judges and counsel feared to extend
their winter’s progress over the bad roads and hills of
Cornwall. The roads are now improved, and the hills
are avoided; and in this year (1834) an order has been
made for holding both assizes in future at the town adjacent
to the prison, nearly in the centre of the county, and
where an increased inducement will be afforded for providing
the accommodation requisite on such occasions.</p>

<p>Launceston itself has received more improvement than
almost any other place as a thoroughfare; the great London
road crossing it from east to west, and one of considerable
importance from north to south.</p>

<p>The exit from the east gate was about ten years ago made
safe, and even convenient, from being dangerous in a very high
degree; and in the present year (1834) a road from the north
<!--436.png--><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a><span class="pageno">432</span>
has been wound round the castle at a very easy ascent, and
avoided altogether a hill so steep as almost to prohibit the
use of wheeled carriages.</p>

<p>Launceston not only sent two Members to Parliament;
but the long street, or suburb extending from the foot of the
hill at the north gate, sent two members more under the
name of Newport. By the act of Parliament of 1832, they
are both included in a district, returning one member.
Launceston is so amply described by recent writers of
the county history, that it would be useless to repeat what
they have given. The general view of the place is magnificent;
and especially from the new iron bridge, completed
this year, across the Tamar at Polston.</p>

<p>The parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Magdalen measures 1090 statute
acres. The present Minister is the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Rowe, appointed
by the Corporation in 1808.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>Doctor Boase observes on the geology, that clayslate,
calcareous schist, limestone, and other rocks belonging to the
calcareous series, constitute the substrature of this parish.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that the conical mound supporting
the keep, as well as the whole extent of the bass court, are
composed of eminences favourable for defence but improved
by art, being scarped in some places and elevated
in others.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">Transcriber Note</h4>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words and names had not
become standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple
spelling variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These
have been left unchanged. Dialect, obsolete and alternative spellings
were left unchanged, as were misspelled words, incorrect use of
homonyms, and sentences without verbs. The book used hyphens, dots, and
spaces of various lengths to indicate unknown names, dates or words.
For consistency, these were changed to a long dash, &mdash;&mdash;.
Insular letters were replaced with contemporary equivalents.</p>

<p>Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside down, missing or
partially printed letters, were corrected. Unprinted punctuation and
final stops missing at the end of abbreviations and sentences were
added. Duplicated words were removed, as were duplicate letters after
rejoining words that were hyphenated at the end of a line.</p>

<p>The list of errata for Volume II and Index, placed at the end of
the book, appear only in Volume 1 and Volume 4, respectively. These
were added for the convenience of readers. Links are provided only to items
in this volume.</p>
